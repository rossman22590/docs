## How to Use MeshCraft

Follow these comprehensive steps to create your 3D model:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Input Type" icon="upload">
    Choose between **IMAGE TO 3D** or a text-based type (like GENERAL, OBJECT, ANIMAL, HUMAN) from the **Select Type** dropdown.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide Input" icon="pen-to-square">
    - For **IMAGE TO 3D**: Upload an image file.
    - For text-based types: Enter a text prompt (or multiple prompts depending on the type).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust Settings" icon="sliders">
    Configure the available parameters based on your selected type (see Input Parameters section below).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate 3D Model" icon="play">
    Click the **Generate 3D Model** button. The AI will process your input and settings to create your 3D model.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Image to 3D Mode

This mode allows you to generate a 3D model directly from a 2D image.

    From the **Select Type** dropdown, choose **IMAGE TO 3D**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Image" icon="upload">
    Click **Upload Image** and select the image file you want to convert to 3D. Wait for the upload to complete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Seed" icon="seedling">
    Enter a **Seed** number for reproducible results.

  <Step title="Generate 3D Model" icon="play">
    Click the **Generate 3D Model** button.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Text to 3D Mode (General Example)

This mode allows you to generate a 3D model from a text description. The available prompts and settings vary depending on the specific text-based type selected (GENERAL, OBJECT, ANIMAL, HUMAN).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Text Type" icon="keyboard">
    From the **Select Type** dropdown, choose a text-based type like **GENERAL**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Prompt" icon="pencil">
    In the **Prompt** field, enter a text description of the 3D model you want to generate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust Settings (Optional)" icon="sliders">
    Depending on the selected type (e.g., OBJECT, ANIMAL, HUMAN), additional prompt fields (like Mesh Prompt, Paint Prompts) and settings (like Mesh Variability, Creative, Animation Type/Prompt) may become available for more detailed control.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate 3D Model" icon="play">
    Click the **Generate 3D Model** button.
  </Step>
</Steps>
