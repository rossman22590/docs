#### Mastering the Art of Prompting in PolyCraft

Effective prompting is crucial for achieving the desired results in PolyCraft. This section provides in-depth guidance on crafting powerful prompts that will unlock the full potential of the AI.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Understanding Prompt Structure" icon="layer-group">
    A well-structured prompt typically includes:
    - **Subject**: The main object or character you want to create.
    - **Attributes**: Specific characteristics, materials, or styles.
    - **Context**: The environment or setting of the object.
    - **Perspective**: The angle or view of the 3D model.
    - **Style**: Any particular artistic or design style you want to apply.

    Example: "A sleek, futuristic sports car with glossy red paint and chrome accents, parked in a neon-lit cityscape, viewed from a low front three-quarter angle, in a hyper-realistic style."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Detailing Techniques" icon="magnifying-glass">
    - **Be Specific**: Instead of "a chair," use "a mid-century modern lounge chair with teak wood frame and olive green upholstery."
    - **Use Descriptive Adjectives**: Incorporate words like "weathered," "iridescent," or "angular" to add depth to your description.
    - **Reference Materials**: Mention specific materials like "brushed aluminum," "Moroccan leather," or "Venetian glass" for accurate texturing.
    - **Include Measurements**: When relevant, provide approximate sizes or proportions to guide the AI.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Stylistic Guidance" icon="paintbrush">
    - **Artistic Styles**: Reference specific art movements or styles, e.g., "in the style of Art Nouveau" or "with a cyberpunk aesthetic."
    - **Lighting and Mood**: Describe the lighting conditions or mood, such as "bathed in warm sunset light" or "with an eerie, fog-shrouded atmosphere."
    - **Time Period**: Specify historical or futuristic contexts to influence the design, like "a 1950s diner interior" or "a 22nd-century space habitat."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Leveraging Negative Prompts" icon="ban">
    Use negative prompts to refine your results:
    - Exclude unwanted elements: "No wheels, no windows"
    - Avoid certain styles: "Not cartoonish, not low-poly"
    - Refine materials: "Avoid metallic textures, no glossy surfaces"
    
    Example: "A tree house in a giant oak tree, with multiple levels connected by rope bridges. Negative: No modern materials, no square windows, not symmetrical."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prompt Iteration Strategies" icon="rotate">
    - Start broad and refine: Begin with a general concept and iterate with more specific details.
    - A/B testing: Create variations of your prompt to compare results and identify effective descriptors.
    - Combine successful elements: Take the best aspects from different generations and combine them into a new, refined prompt.
  </Accordion>
