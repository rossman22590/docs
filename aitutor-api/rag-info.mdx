### AI Tutor RAG

AI Tutor RAG is the open-source alternative to Carbon.ai. Build powerful RAG applications with any data source, at any scale. Use the AI Tutor RAG API to generate embeddings from your documents and connect them to AI.

### Getting started

To get started, create an API key in the dashboard and read about how to make requests for the resources you need to access using our HTTP APIs.

###  What is RAG?

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a powerful approach that enhances AI responses with relevant information from your documents. Instead of relying solely on an AI's general knowledge, RAG searches through your specific documents to provide accurate, context-aware answers.

Think of RAG as giving your AI assistant access to your organization's knowledge base. When you ask a question, it first finds the most relevant information from your documents, then uses this specific context to generate a precise answer.

Why RAG Matters
Accurate Responses: Get answers based on your actual documents, not just general AI knowledge
Up-to-date Information: Your AI always references your latest documents
Data Privacy: Keep your sensitive information secure while leveraging AI capabilities
Cost Efficiency: Optimize AI usage by focusing on relevant context
