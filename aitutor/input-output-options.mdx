Input and Output Options
========================

AI Tutor provides a suite of comprehensive tools designed to simplify and enhance your chat generation experience. Understanding that information can come in various formats, AI Tutor allows you to upload files, including PDFs, enabling the AI to read and integrate the content into your interactions. Additionally, the platform supports the uploading of pictures, further enriching the context for your AI conversations.



Beyond the standard chat functionality, AI Tutor introduces several innovative options to tailor your interaction according to your needs. These include:

1.  Write: This option focuses on generating text-based outputs. It's ideal for creating detailed responses, essays, reports, or any written content, leveraging the AI's capability to understand and articulate ideas clearly.

2.  Draw: For those who require visual representations, the Draw feature enables the AI to create sketches or diagrams. This is particularly useful in fields like design, architecture, or any area where visual aids can enhance understanding.

3.  Reason + Act: This advanced feature allows the AI to not only process information but also make inferences and suggest actions based on the provided data. It's especially useful for scenario-based learning, problem-solving, and decision-making exercises.

4.  Browse Command: This advanced feature allows the AI to scrape a website and keep the content in context. Use /browse to activate!

Each option modifies how the AI processes your input and generates output, allowing for a customized chat generation experience tailored to your specific project or learning objective.


Whether you're looking to draft a document, visualize concepts, or engage in complex reasoning, AI Tutor's versatile tools are designed to accommodate a wide range of educational and creative needs.
