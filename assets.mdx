The **Assets** page is your library of everything you’ve **generated** and everything you’ve **uploaded**. It has two tabs: **Generated** and **Uploads**.

## Access

- **Sidebar**: Click **Assets** (or “My Assets” on the home grid).

## Tabs

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card icon="wand-magic-sparkles" title="Generated">
    All **generated_content** for your account: images, video, audio, 3D. Same data as the “history” on the Generate page, in a dedicated list. Paginated (e.g. 20 per page).
  </Card>
  <Card icon="upload" title="Uploads">
    **User uploads**: files you uploaded (images, etc.) for use in generation or the video editor. Loaded via `getUserUploads` and shown with signed URLs where needed.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Generated Tab

- Shows **generated_content** rows: thumbnail/preview, type (image/video/audio/3d), status, creation time.
- Actions (depending on UI): open in preview, **download**, **publish to gallery**, **delete**.
- **Delete**: Uses `deleteGeneratedContentAction`; only your (or your account’s) content can be deleted.

## Uploads Tab

- Shows **user uploads** (from the storage/asset system). Used as inputs for models (e.g. ControlNet, image-to-video) or in the video editor.
- Upload flow elsewhere in the app uses **presigned URLs** and **createUploadRecord** to add new uploads; they then appear here.

## Why Use Assets

- **Reuse**: Find a past generation or upload to use as input for a new generation.
- **Manage**: Delete old content or bulk-export if the UI supports it.
- **Publish**: From here or from Generate, publish items to the **public gallery**.

<Info>
  Assets are scoped to your **account**. With team accounts, members see the same shared assets.
