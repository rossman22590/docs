<Tip>
  Transform text and documents into natural-sounding audio with customizable AI voices and styles!
</Tip>

## Overview

AudioCraft is a versatile AI tool that allows you to generate audio content in two primary ways: creating dialogue-based audio from text input (**Studio mode**) or narrating content from PDFs or entered text (**Narration mode**). With a selection of AI voices and synthesis styles, AudioCraft is ideal for creating podcasts, voiceovers, audiobooks, and more.
