# ClipCraft: AI-Powered Audio Generation

<Tip>
  Transform videos into audio or create original soundscapes from text with ClipCraft's advanced AI capabilities!
</Tip>

## Overview

ClipCraft is a versatile AI tool that allows you to generate audio in two distinct ways: by extracting and transforming the sound from an existing video (**Video to Audio**) or by creating entirely new audio based on a text description (**Text to Audio**). Leveraging powerful AI models, ClipCraft provides creative control over the generated sound, making it ideal for content creators, musicians, and anyone looking to explore AI-driven audio production.

## How to Use ClipCraft

ClipCraft offers two primary modes, accessible via the tabs at the top of the interface.

### Video to Audio Mode

This mode allows you to generate audio that is influenced by both an input video and a text prompt.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Video to Audio Tab" icon="video">
    Click on the **Video to Audio** tab at the top of the page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload or Link Video" icon="upload">
    Upload a video file (MP4 recommended) or enter a video URL. This video will serve as a visual reference for the AI during audio generation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Your Prompt" icon="keyboard">
    In the **Prompt** field, describe the audio you want to generate. This prompt will guide the AI, using the video's content as context.

    *Example Prompts:*
    - "Indian holy music"
    - "A dramatic orchestral score"
    - "Ambient nature sounds"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust Parameters" icon="sliders">
    Configure the various settings like **Duration, Number of Steps, CFG Strength, Negative Prompt, and Seed** to fine-tune the audio generation (see Input Parameters section below).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Video with Audio" icon="play">
    Click the **Generate Video with Audio** button. The AI will process the video and prompt to create a new audio track, which will be combined with a generated video output.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Text to Audio Mode

This mode allows you to generate audio purely from a text description.

</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Text to Audio Tab" icon="keyboard">
    Click on the **Text to Audio** tab at the top of the page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe the Desired Audio" icon="comment">
    In the **Prompt** field, provide a detailed text description of the audio you want to generate.

    *Example Prompts:*
    - "Piano solo with violin accompaniment"
    - "Sound of rain falling on a tin roof"
    - "Upbeat electronic dance music"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust Parameters" icon="sliders">
    Configure the various settings like **Duration, Number of Steps, CFG Strength, Negative Prompt, and Seed** to fine-tune the audio generation (see Input Parameters section below).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Audio" icon="play">
    Click the **Generate Audio** button. The AI will create an audio file based solely on your text prompt and parameters.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Input Parameters and Options

ClipCraft provides several parameters to customize your audio generation:

<ResponseField name="Prompt" type="string" required>
  A text description guiding the AI on the desired audio content or style.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="Duration (seconds)" type="integer">
  Sets the length of the generated audio clip. Maximum is 30 seconds.

  Default: 8 seconds | Range: 1-30 seconds
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="Number of Steps" type="integer">
  Controls the detail and refinement of the generation process. Higher values can lead to more detailed audio but may increase processing time.

  Default: 25
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="CFG Strength" type="float">
  Controls how closely the generated audio adheres to your text prompt. Higher values result in audio that sticks more strictly to the prompt.

  Default: 4.5
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="Negative Prompt" type="string">
  Specify elements or qualities you want the AI to avoid in the generated audio.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="Seed (Optional)" type="integer">
  A number that initializes the random generation process. Using the same seed with the same prompt and settings will produce reproducible results. Leave empty for a random seed.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="Video URL / Upload Video" type="string / file">
  (Only in Video to Audio mode) The video source to provide visual context for audio generation.
</ResponseField>

## Tips for Best Results

  <Card title="Be Descriptive" icon="pencil">
    Provide clear and specific prompts, especially in Text to Audio mode, to guide the AI effectively.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Negative Prompts" icon="ban">
    Actively use the Negative Prompt field to steer the AI away from unwanted sounds or styles.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Experiment with Parameters" icon="sliders">
    Adjust Duration, Steps, and CFG Strength to find the perfect balance for your desired audio.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Leverage Video Context" icon="video">
    In Video to Audio mode, choose videos where the visual content strongly relates to the audio you want to generate.
  </Card>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with ClipCraft, consider these solutions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Poor Audio Quality" icon="volume-xmark">
    Try increasing the **Number of Steps** or adjusting the **CFG Strength**. Ensure your prompt is clear.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Audio Doesn't Match Prompt" icon="comment-slash">
    Increase the **CFG Strength** to make the AI adhere more closely to the prompt. Refine your prompt to be more specific.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Audio Doesn't Match Video (Video to Audio Mode)" icon="video-slash">
    Ensure your prompt aligns with the visual content of the video. Try a different video or adjust parameters.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Processing Errors" icon="bug">
    Check your internet connection. If using a video URL, ensure it's publicly accessible and in a supported format. Try simplifying your prompt.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reproducibility Issues" icon="seedling">
    Ensure you are using the exact same **Seed**, **Prompt**, and all other parameters for consistent results.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Conclusion

ClipCraft provides a powerful and flexible platform for AI-driven audio generation. Whether you're creating soundscapes from text or generating audio inspired by video, its intuitive interface and customizable parameters empower you to bring your auditory visions to life.
