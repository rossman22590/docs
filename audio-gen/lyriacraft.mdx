## Prompt Guide

Good prompts are descriptive and clear. To get your generated music closer to what you want, start with identifying your core musical idea and then refine your idea by adding keywords and modifiers.

### Basic Prompt Structure
Effective Lyria 2 prompts should include:

- **Genre/Style**: "ambient electronic," "jazz fusion," "cinematic orchestral"
- **Mood/Emotion**: "melancholic," "uplifting," "mysterious," "energetic"
- **Instrumentation**: "piano and strings," "synthesizers and drums," "acoustic guitar"
- **Tempo/Energy**: "slow and contemplative," "driving beat," "moderate pace"

Example: "Ambient electronic music with soft synthesizer pads and gentle piano melodies, creating a peaceful and introspective atmosphere"

### Advanced Prompting Techniques
For more sophisticated results, incorporate:

- **Production Style**: "lo-fi," "crisp and clean," "warm analog sound"
- **Musical Elements**: "arpeggiated patterns," "sustained chords," "rhythmic percussion"
- **Atmospheric Details**: "reverb-drenched," "intimate close-miked sound," "spacious mix"

Example: "Cinematic orchestral piece with soaring strings, powerful brass sections, and thunderous percussion, building to an epic crescendo with warm, film-score production"

### Genre-Specific Approaches

<CardGroup cols={3}>
    <Card title="Electronic Music">
        Describe the synthesizer types and beat patterns you want. Try "Deep house with warm analog bass, crisp hi-hats, and atmospheric pads."
    </Card>
    <Card title="Orchestral Music">
        Specify which instrument sections to include. Use prompts like "Chamber orchestra with intimate string quartet and solo woodwind melodies."
    </Card>
    <Card title="Ambient Music">
        Focus on atmosphere rather than rhythm. Describe textures with prompts like "Ethereal ambient soundscape with evolving textures and subtle harmonic shifts."
    </Card>

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Don't make your prompts too complicated.** Keep them simple and focused.
- **Avoid contradictory instructions** like asking for music that's both "fast and slow."
- **Be specific** about what you want instead of using vague descriptions.
- **Always use the negative prompt field** to exclude unwanted sounds.
