# PodCraft: AI-Powered Conversational Audio

<Tip>
  Unleash the power of conversational AI with PodCraft! Generate expressive, long-form, multi-speaker audio, such as podcasts, from text.
</Tip>

## Overview

PodCraft is a novel framework designed for generating **expressive**, **long-form**, **multi-speaker** conversational audio, such as podcasts, from text. It addresses significant challenges in traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems, particularly in scalability, speaker consistency, and natural turn-taking.

A core innovation of PodCraft is its use of continuous speech tokenizers (Acoustic and Semantic) operating at an ultra-low frame rate of 7.5 Hz. These tokenizers efficiently preserve audio fidelity while significantly boosting computational efficiency for processing long sequences. PodCraft employs a next-token diffusion framework, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand textual context and dialogue flow, and a diffusion head to generate high-fidelity acoustic details.

The model can synthesize speech up to **90 minutes** long with up to **4 distinct speakers**, surpassing the typical 1-2 speaker limits of many prior models.

## How to Use PodCraft

<Steps>
  <Step title="Compose a Script">
