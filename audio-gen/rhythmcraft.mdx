# RhythmCraft: AI-Powered Music Generation with Timestamps

<Tip>
  Compose music synchronized with your lyrics by providing timestamped text and reference audio!
</Tip>

## Overview

RhythmCraft is an AI tool that specializes in generating music based on **timestamped lyrics** and a **reference audio track**. This allows for precise synchronization between the vocals (represented by the timestamped lyrics) and the generated music. It's perfect for musicians, producers, or anyone wanting to create music where the timing of the vocals is a critical element.

## How to Use RhythmCraft

Follow these steps to generate music with RhythmCraft:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Timestamped Lyrics" icon="keyboard">
    Input your song lyrics into the **Lyrics** text area. Your lyrics **must** include timestamps in the format `[MM:SS.ms]` at the beginning of each line or section you want timed.

    *Example Timestamped Lyrics:*
    ```
    [00:05.25] This is the first line
    [00:08.00] And this is the second line
    [00:12.50] Starting a new verse here
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Timestamps (Optional)" icon="clock">
    If your lyrics do not have timestamps, click the **Generate Timestamps** button. This opens a modal where you can set parameters (like start time, line interval, and section interval) to automatically add timestamps to your lyrics. Review the preview and click **Apply Timestamps** to use the generated timestamps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide Reference Audio" icon="upload">
    Choose how to provide reference audio:
    - **Upload Reference Audio**: Click **Choose File** to upload an audio file from your device (MP3 or WAV recommended).
    - **Reference Audio URL**: Enter the URL of an existing audio file online.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust Parameters" icon="sliders">
    Configure the generation settings using the sliders:
    - **Number of Inference Steps**: Controls the detail and refinement of the music.
    - **Max Frames**: Sets the maximum length or complexity of the generated audio.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Music" icon="play">
    Click the **Generate Music** button. Ensure you have enough credits (20 credits per song). The AI will generate the music synchronized with your timestamped lyrics and influenced by the reference audio.
  </Step>
</Steps>
