#### **Step-by-Step Guide to Using Soundcraft**

1.  **Enter Your Sound Prompt**:
    
    *   Begin by typing a prompt that describes the sound effect you need. Be as specific as possible to ensure the AI accurately captures the essence of the sound you envision. For example, "the sound of rain hitting a tin roof" or "a bustling city street."
        
2.  **Adjust Duration and Steps**:
    
    *   **Duration**: Set the length of time for which you want the sound effect to play. This could be a few seconds for a quick effect or longer for a more sustained sound.
        
    *   **Steps**: Adjust the steps to fine-tune how the sound evolves over time. This feature allows you to control the progression of the sound effect, adding depth and complexity to the audio.
        
3.  **Generate Your Sound**:
    
    *   With your prompt entered and settings adjusted, click the generate button. The AI will process your input and create a sound effect that matches your specifications.
        
4.  **Download Your Sound**:
    
    *   Once the sound effect is generated, you have the option to listen to it directly on the platform. If it meets your expectations, you can download the file to your device for use in your projects.
