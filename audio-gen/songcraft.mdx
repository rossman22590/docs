#### **Step-by-Step Guide to Using Songcraft Beta**

1.  **Input Your Core Phrase**:
    
    *   Start by entering a phrase that captures the essence of what you want your song to be about. This phrase will serve as the foundation for the lyrics and theme of your song.
        
2.  **Selecting the Theme**:
    
    *   Choose a theme from the dropdown menu provided by Songcraft Beta. The theme should reflect the overall mood or message you want to convey in your song.
        
    *   If the available themes do not perfectly match your vision, you have the option to create a custom theme that better suits your song's concept.
        
3.  **Choosing the Tone**:
    
    *   Similar to the theme, select a tone for your song from another dropdown menu. The tone will influence the emotional delivery of the lyrics and music.
        
    *   As with the theme, you can also customize the tone if the pre-set options do not meet your needs.
        
4.  **Generating Lyrics**:
    
    *   You can generate lyrics by typing keywords or phrases into the designated area. These inputs will guide the AI in creating lyric content that aligns with your theme and tone.
        
    *   Alternatively, if you have specific lyrics in mind, you can enter them manually, allowing for greater personalization of your song.
        
5.  **Utilizing Tags**:
    
    *   At the bottom of the interface, you'll find an area to input tags. These tags should describe key elements or characteristics you want in your song, such as "upbeat," "melancholic," or "inspirational."
        
    *   Tags help refine the song generation process, ensuring the final product aligns with your artistic intentions.
        
6.  **Adding a Title**:
    
    *   Finally, give your song a title. This title should encapsulate the core theme or message of the song and catch the listener's attention.
        
7.  **Generate Your Music**:
    
    *   Once all elements are in place, click the "Generate" button to create your music. The AI will process your inputs and produce a song that reflects your specified preferences and style.
        
    *   After generating your music, don't forget to download your audio to save for future projects.
        
        *   _Please note some sounds may take up to 60 seconds to download._
