# SpeechCraft: AI-Powered Voice Conversion

<Tip>
  Generate speech in a specific voice by providing text and a reference audio sample!
</Tip>

## Overview

SpeechCraft is an AI tool that allows you to convert written text into spoken audio, mimicking the voice characteristics from a reference audio sample. This is useful for creating voiceovers, narration, or dialogue in a consistent voice without needing to record the voice actor for every line.
