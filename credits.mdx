Pixio uses **credits** for what you create and **subscriptions** for billing. Your **plan** decides which models you can use and how many credits you get.

## How Credits Work

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card icon="coins" title="Credits per creation">
    Each image, video, or other creation uses **credits**. The cost depends on the model and settings (e.g. resolution, length).
  </Card>
  <Card icon="exclamation-triangle" title="When you run out">
    If you run out of credits, you’ll see a message and can go to **Billing** to upgrade your plan or get more credits.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Free Credits

When you **sign up**, you get **free credits** so you can try Pixio and create your first images, videos, or audio without paying.

## Plans

Different plans give you different access and credit amounts. Typical plan names you might see:

| Plan        | What it’s for                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Free**    | Get started with free credits and limited models. |
| **Starter** | First paid tier — more credits and more models.   |
| **Pro**     | For regular creators — more credits and access.   |
| **Premium** | Higher limits and premium models.                 |
| **Maker**   | For power users and teams.                        |

Your subscription is managed on the **Billing** page. There you can see your plan, update payment details, or change plans.

## Billing Page

- Open **Billing** from the sidebar or your account menu.
- On a **team account**, billing may be managed by a team admin.

## Personal vs Team

- **Personal account** — Your own credits and subscription.
- **Team account** — Shared workspace; the team has its own plan and credits. Members use the same pool according to your team settings.

  Exact plan names and limits can vary. Check the Billing page in the app for your options.
