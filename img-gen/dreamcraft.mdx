# DreamCraft: Explore AI Imagery with HiDream

<Tip>
  Unleash your creative dreams with DreamCraft! Powered by the open-source HiDream model, generate stunning images or edit existing ones with intuitive controls.
</Tip>

## Overview

DreamCraft is a versatile AI image tool built upon the open-source **HiDream-I1** model and its editing counterpart, **HiDream-E1**. It offers two primary modes: **Generate**, for creating images from text prompts, and **Edit**, for performing maskless modifications on existing images. DreamCraft provides access to different "flavors" of the HiDream-I1 model (Fast, Balanced, Quality) and leverages the E1 model for its editing capabilities, making advanced AI image creation and modification more accessible.

## Modes of Operation

DreamCraft offers two distinct modes to suit your creative workflow:

### Generate Mode: Create Images from Text

In Generate mode, you can create entirely new images by providing a text prompt. You can select from different versions ("flavors") of the HiDream-I1 model to prioritize speed or quality.

</Frame>

**Inputs & Options (Generate Mode):**

*   **Prompt**: Your text description of the desired image.

### Edit Mode: Maskless Image Modification

Edit mode allows you to modify an existing image simply by providing written instructions. This uses the HiDream-E1 model, which is designed for image-to-image editing without requiring manual masking.

## Understanding the HiDream Model

DreamCraft is powered by the open-source HiDream model series, which includes the HiDream-I1 (for generation) and HiDream-E1 (for editing) models.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="HiDream-I1 (Generation)" icon="cubes">
    Available in **Fast, Balanced, and Quality** versions. The Full model is large, but quantized versions (like Q8) can run on GPUs with less VRAM. It uses **four text encoders** to interpret prompts, which can be complex but allows for nuanced prompt tuning. Prompt adherence is generally good, and small changes to the prompt often don't reset the whole image, making iterative prompting easier.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="HiDream-E1 (Editing)" icon="pencil">
    A natural language capable image editing model. It performs **maskless editing** based on an input image and a text instruction. It is designed for image-to-image editing without requiring manual masking, similar to inpainting or outpainting but driven purely by text.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Mastering Prompts for DreamCraft

Prompting in DreamCraft varies based on the mode.

### Prompting in Generate Mode:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="General Prompts" icon="keyboard">
    Describe the desired image, including subjects, scenes, styles, lighting, and mood.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multiple Text Encoders" icon="code">
    While the interface provides a single prompt input, the underlying HiDream-I1 model uses four text encoders. This means the model interprets different aspects of your prompt through various lenses (e.g., one encoder might be better with tags, others with natural language). Experiment with prompt structure and wording to see how the different models respond.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Prompting in Edit Mode:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Edit Instruction" icon="pencil">
    Clearly describe the specific changes you want to make to the uploaded image.
    *Example:* "change the color of the car to red," "add a flower on the table."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Target Image Description (Optional)" icon="image">
    Describe what the final edited image should look like overall. This can help guide the AI's blending and consistency.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
