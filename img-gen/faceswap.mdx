For best results, choose a high-quality image where the face is clearly visible and well-lit. </Accordion> <Accordion title="Step 2: Add in the Face Picture" icon="user-plus"> Next, upload the **face picture** that you wish to swap onto the base photo. The face picture should be as clear as possible and ideally have a similar angle and lighting to the base photo for a seamless swap. </Accordion> <Accordion title="Step 3: Swap Faces" icon="right-left"> With both images selected, hit the **'Swap Faces'** button. The tool will automatically process the images, applying advanced AI algorithms to adjust and blend the swapped face naturally into the base photo. </Accordion> <Accordion title="Step 4: Fine-Tune the Swap (Optional)" icon="gear"> If needed, use the **manual fine-tuning options** to adjust the size, position, or rotation of the swapped face.

### Advice for Best Practices
<AccordionGroup> <Accordion title="Choose High-Quality Images" icon="check"> For the most realistic face swaps, choose high-quality, clear, and well-lit images. Faces should be easily distinguishable, and photos with high resolution will result in more seamless swaps. </Accordion> <Accordion title="Match Angles and Lighting" icon="sun"> For a natural-looking swap, try to **match the angles and lighting conditions** between the base photo and the face picture. Differences in these factors can make the swap look less convincing. Adjusting photos beforehand to ensure similar lighting or angle will yield the best results. </Accordion> <Accordion title="Use Manual Adjustments" icon="sliders"> If the automatic swap doesn't align perfectly, use the **manual fine-tuning tools**. These tools let you adjust the face's position, size, and angle, helping you achieve a more natural and precise result. </Accordion> <Accordion title="Experiment for Fun" icon="face-laugh"> The FaceSwap tool is perfect for fun and creative projects.
