# FlashCraft: Copyright-Safe AI Image Generation with F-Lite

<Tip>
  Create stunning visuals with confidence using FlashCraft! Powered by the F-Lite model, generate copyright-safe images for your projects, available in Standard and Texture modes.
</Tip>

## Overview

FlashCraft is an innovative AI image generation tool built upon the **F-Lite model**, a 10B parameter diffusion model developed by Freepik and Fal. F-Lite is uniquely trained on a massive dataset of **exclusively copyright-safe and SFW (Safe for Work) content**, making FlashCraft the ideal choice for creators and businesses who prioritize legal compliance and safe imagery. It offers two distinct modes: **Standard**, for general image generation, and **Texture**, specialized for creating seamless textures.

## Modes of Operation

FlashCraft offers two distinct modes to suit your creative workflow:

### Standard Mode: General Image Generation

In Standard mode, you can generate a wide variety of images from text prompts, leveraging the general capabilities of the F-Lite model.


**Inputs & Options (Standard Mode):**

*   **Prompt**: Your text description of the desired image.
*   **Negative Prompt**: Specify elements to omit.
*   **Image Size**: Select the resolution and aspect ratio.
    *   Possible values: `square_hd`, `square`, `portrait_4_3`, `portrait_16_9`, `landscape_4_3`, `landscape_16_9`, `custom` (with width/height inputs).
*   **Num Inference Steps**: Controls detail (1-50, default 28).
*   **Seed**: For reproducible results (optional).
*   **Guidance Scale**: Adjusts adherence to prompt (0-20, default 3.5).
*   **Number of Images**: Number of variations to generate (1-4).

### Texture Mode: Seamless Texture Generation

Texture mode is specialized for creating images that can be tiled seamlessly, making them ideal for backgrounds, patterns, and digital assets requiring repetition.

**Inputs & Options (Texture Mode):**

*   **Prompt**: Your text description of the desired texture.
*   **Negative Prompt**: Specify elements to omit.
*   **Image Size**: Select the resolution and aspect ratio.
    *   Possible values: `square_hd`, `square`, `portrait_4_3`, `portrait_16_9`, `landscape_4_3`, `landscape_16_9`, `custom` (with width/height inputs).
*   **Num Inference Steps**: Controls detail (1-50, default 28).
*   **Seed**: For reproducible results (optional).
*   **Guidance Scale**: Adjusts adherence to prompt (0-20, default 3.5).
*   **Number of Images**: Number of variations to generate (1-4).

## Mastering Prompts for FlashCraft

To get the best results from FlashCraft, especially given the F-Lite model's training data and limitations, prompt writing is important.

### General Prompting Principles:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Long, Detailed Prompts" icon="pencil">
    According to the F-Lite technical report, using longer prompts can help generate better results and avoid low-quality images. Provide ample detail about your desired image or texture.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Aim for Images Above Megapixel" icon="expand">
    To avoid low-quality outputs, aim to generate images larger than one megapixel. Select larger image sizes or custom dimensions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Natural Language" icon="comments">
    Formulate your prompts using descriptive sentences.
  </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Consider Negative Prompts" icon="ban">
    Use the negative prompt field to steer the AI away from unwanted elements or artifacts.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Prompting for Specific Modes:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Standard Mode Prompts" icon="image">
    Describe the desired image content, style, lighting, and composition. Focus on creating a clear visual scene.
    *Example:* "A photorealistic portrait of a person with dramatic lighting," or "A vibrant digital painting of a fantasy landscape."
  </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Texture Mode Prompts" icon="swatchbook">
    Describe the desired texture pattern, material, or visual style. Emphasize repetitive elements or seamless patterns.
    *Example:* "A seamless pattern of intertwining leaves and vines," or "A texture of rough concrete with subtle cracks."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How to Use FlashCraft

Embark on your creative journey with this general workflow:

<Steps>

  <Step title="Provide Your Prompt" icon="keyboard">
    Enter your text description for the image or texture you want to generate. Remember to use long and detailed prompts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust Settings" icon="sliders">
    Configure settings like Image Size, Num Inference Steps, Guidance Scale, Seed, and Number of Images. Ensure you select an Image Size that results in an image above one megapixel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Image" icon="play">
    Click the "Generate" button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Download" icon="eye">

## Input Parameters and Options

FlashCraft offers a range of input parameters for image generation:

<ResponseField name="prompt" type="string" required>
  Your text description guiding the image creation. **Recommendation: Use long and detailed prompts.**
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="negative_prompt" type="string">
  A text prompt specifying elements, styles, or characteristics to avoid.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="image_size" type="string | object" required>
  The desired dimensions or aspect ratio for the output image. Can be selected from presets (e.g., `square_hd`, `landscape_4_3`) or specified with custom `width` and `height`. **Recommendation: Generate images above one megapixel.**
