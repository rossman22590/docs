### Understanding LoRAs in FluxCraft

LoRAs (Low-Rank Adaptation) are powerful tools that help fine-tune AI models for specific styles, subjects, or concepts without retraining the entire model. In FluxCraft, LoRAs enable you to generate more targeted and personalized images by incorporating specialized visual elements or styles into your creations.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 3: Configure LoRA" icon="sliders">
    Enter the LoRA link in the provided field and adjust the LoRA scale.

    **LoRA Scale**: This parameter controls the strength of the LoRA's influence on the generated image. A higher scale means a stronger effect, while a lower scale results in a more subtle influence.
