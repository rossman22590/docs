### Prompt Crafting Techniques with Examples

1. **Be Specific and Descriptive**

   Poor: "A portrait of a woman"
   Better: "A close-up portrait of a middle-aged woman with curly red hair, green eyes, and freckles, wearing a blue silk blouse"

2. **Use Artistic References**

   Example: "Create an image in the style of Vincent van Gogh's 'Starry Night,' but replace the village with a futuristic cityscape"

3. **Specify Technical Details**

   Example: "Capture a street food vendor in Tokyo at night, shot with a wide-angle lens (24mm) at f/1.8, shallow depth of field"

4. **Blend Concepts**

   Example: "Illustrate 'The Last Supper' by Leonardo da Vinci, but reimagine it with robots in a futuristic setting"

5. **Use Contrast and Juxtaposition**

   Example: "Create an image that juxtaposes the delicate beauty of nature with the harsh reality of urban decay"

6. **Incorporate Mood and Atmosphere**

   Example: "Depict a cozy, warmly lit bookstore cafe on a rainy evening, with an inviting and nostalgic atmosphere"

7. **Leverage Text Rendering Capabilities**

   Example: "Create a surreal advertisement poster for a fictional time travel agency with the text 'CHRONO TOURS: YOUR PAST IS OUR FUTURE' in a retro-futuristic font"

8. **Experiment with Unusual Perspectives**

   Example: "Illustrate a 'bug's-eye view' of a picnic in a lush garden, looking up at towering blades of grass and wildflowers"

## Advanced Techniques with Examples

### Layered Prompts

Example: "Create a bustling marketplace in a fantastical floating city.

1. Background: Depict a city of interconnected floating islands suspended in a pastel sky.
2. Middle ground: Focus on the main marketplace area with colorful stalls and shops.
3. Foreground: Populate the scene with diverse fantasy creatures and humanoids.
4. Atmosphere: The overall mood should be vibrant and magical, with soft, ethereal lighting."

### Style Fusion

Example: "Create an image that fuses the precision of M.C. Escher's impossible geometries with the bold colors and shapes of Wassily Kandinsky's abstract compositions. The subject should be a surreal cityscape where buildings seamlessly transform into musical instruments."

### Temporal Narratives

Example: "Illustrate the life cycle of a monarch butterfly in a single, continuous image. Divide the canvas into four seamlessly blending sections, each representing a stage of the butterfly's life: egg, caterpillar, chrysalis, and adult butterfly."

### Emotional Gradients

Example: "Create a panoramic image that depicts the progression of a person's emotional journey from despair to hope. The scene should be a long, winding road that starts in a dark, stormy landscape and gradually transitions to a bright, sunlit meadow."

## Complete Prompt Examples

1. **The Hyperrealistic Portrait**

   "Hyperrealistic close-up portrait of an elderly Inuit woman in her 80s. She should have deep wrinkles, weathered skin, and wise, piercing dark eyes. Her silver hair is braided and adorned with traditional bone beads. She's wearing a fur-trimmed parka. Capture the soft, golden light of the Arctic midnight sun reflecting in her eyes and on her skin."

2. **The Style Fusion Challenge**

   "Blend the surrealism of Salvador Dalí with the geometric abstraction of Piet Mondrian to depict a melting cityscape. Use Dalí's soft, drooping forms for skyscrapers that are liquefying, but render them in Mondrian's characteristic primary colors and black grid lines. The sky should be divided into rectangles of different shades of blue and white, with a few of Dalí's signature clouds scattered about."

3. **The Impossible Architecture**

   "Design an M.C. Escher-inspired infinite staircase structure floating in a starry void. The stairs should seamlessly loop in impossible ways, defying gravity and perspective. Incorporate elements of ancient Greek architecture like columns and archways into the staircase design. Place small, silhouetted figures on various parts of the structure to give a sense of scale. Use a cool color palette dominated by deep purples and blues, with warm yellow lighting accenting key areas."

4. **The Micro-Macro Juxtaposition**

   "Create a split-screen image. On the left, show an extreme close-up of a human eye, with intricate details of the iris visible. On the right, depict a vast spiral galaxy. The colors and patterns of the iris should mirror the structure of the galaxy, implying a connection between the micro and macro scales. Use a rich color palette with deep blues, purples, and flecks of gold in both halves of the image."

## Tips for Optimal Results
