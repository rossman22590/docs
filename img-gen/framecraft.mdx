</CardGroup>

## References Mode: Blending Concepts

References mode allows you to upload existing images and use them to guide the AI's creation, blending elements, styles, or concepts from your references into a new image.

<Frame>
  <img src="https://pixiomedia.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/docs/Screenshot%202025-05-13%20175357.png" alt="FrameCraft References Screenshot" />
</Frame>

**Inputs & Options (References Mode):**

*   **Reference Images**: Upload up to **3 reference images** into the provided slots. These images will serve as visual inputs for the AI.
*   **Prompt**: Enter a text description that guides how the AI should use the reference images and what the final output should look like.
*   **Style**: Select a predefined artistic style (same options as Generate mode).
*   **Aspect Ratio**: Choose the desired shape for your image (same options as Generate mode).
*   **Diversity**: Adjust a slider to control the variation among the generated images.
*   **Seed** (Optional): Enter a specific number for reproducible results.

### Prompting with References

When using References mode, your prompt needs to tell the AI how to combine the visual information from the uploaded images. You can refer to the images by their number (e.g., `image1`, `image2`, `image3`).

**Prompt Structure for References:**

Describe the desired output, explicitly referencing elements from your uploaded images using `image1`, `image2`, and `image3`.

<Callout type="example">
  *Example Prompt:*
  "the subject from image1, wearing the hoodie from image2, with the setting from image3 behind him"
</Callout>

### References Mode Example

See how FrameCraft can combine elements from multiple images based on a prompt:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Reference Image 1">
    <img src="https://pixiomedia.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/docs/generated_image_2.png" alt="Reference Example 1" />
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reference Image 2">

## Mastering Prompts for FrameCraft

Effective prompting is crucial for both Generate and References modes. FrameCraft excels at interpreting detailed, natural language prompts.

### Prompting Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Descriptive, Not Conversational" icon="pencil">
    Focus on painting a vivid picture with your words. Avoid conversational phrases like "can you please generate..."
