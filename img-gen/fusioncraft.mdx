## Mastering Prompts for FusionCraft

Prompting in FusionCraft depends on the model and tool you select. Each model responds differently to prompt complexity and stylistic cues.

### General Prompting Principles:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Specificity is Key" icon="pencil">
    Provide clear details about your desired image, especially for models like Quality and Photo. Describe subjects, actions, settings, styles, and mood.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Understand Tool Influence" icon="toolbox">
    Your prompt's interpretation is heavily influenced by the selected tool. A prompt for "Generate" will be interpreted differently than the same prompt used with "Fill" or "Redux".
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Natural Language" icon="comments">
    Formulate your prompts using descriptive sentences.
  </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Consider Negative Prompts" icon="ban">
    Use the negative prompt field to steer the AI away from unwanted elements or artifacts.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Prompting for Specific Models/Tools:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Fast & Balanced" icon="bolt">
    These models often perform well with straightforward, clear prompts. Focus on the core subject and scene.
    Example: "A cat sitting on a windowsill looking at the rain."
  </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Quality & Photo" icon="star">
    These models benefit from more detailed and nuanced prompts, including specifics about lighting, camera style, and artistic details for higher fidelity.
    Example: "A close-up portrait of an elderly person with kind eyes, soft studio lighting, shallow depth of field, shot on a vintage film camera."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Inpainting" icon="brush">
    Describe what you want to appear within the masked area. Focus on the object or scene you want to generate and how it should blend with the existing image.
    Example: (Mask over a blank wall) Prompt: "A vibrant graffiti mural covering the wall."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Image to Image" icon="image">
     Describe the desired transformation or style for the input image.
    Example: (Input: Photo of a building) Prompt: "Turn this building into a stained glass window, vibrant colors, intricate patterns, glowing light."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Redux" icon="rotate">
    Describe the desired changes or the new style you want to apply to the input image, focusing on the elements you want to modify or replace.
    Example: (Input: Photo of a person) Prompt: "Give them a superhero costume, red and blue, cape flowing in the wind."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="LoRAs (Photo & Inpainting)" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Include the LoRA's specific **trigger word** in your prompt. Then, describe the scene or subject you want, incorporating the concept or style the LoRA was trained on.
    Example: (Using a "fantasy creature" LoRA with trigger "mythicbeast") Prompt: "A majestic **mythicbeast** perched on a cliff overlooking a misty valley."
  </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="ControlNets" icon="vector-square">
    Your prompt describes the *content* and *style* of the image, while the ControlNet image provides the *structure* or *composition*. Ensure your prompt aligns with the structural guide provided by the ControlNet image.
    Example: (ControlNet: Canny edges of a building) Prompt: "A beautiful watercolor painting of an ancient castle at sunset." (The AI will generate a watercolor painting of a castle following the edge structure of your input image).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Reference Image (Custom Model)" icon="object-group">
    Describe the desired image, indicating how the AI should draw inspiration from the reference image(s). You can reference specific images if using multiple.
    Example: (Reference Image 1: A character, Reference Image 2: A scene) Prompt: "Generate a portrait of the person from image1 standing in the setting from image2."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Prompt Examples

Here are some examples showcasing prompting for different scenarios:

<CodeBlock title="Generate: Sci-Fi City">
  A sprawling futuristic city at night, illuminated by neon lights and flying vehicles. High angle view, digital painting, vibrant colors, moody atmosphere.
</CodeBlock>

  (Using LoRA with trigger "cyberart") Prompt: "A portrait of a woman in the rain, **cyberart**, neon reflections, detailed face, moody lighting."
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title="ControlNet: Match Composition">
  (ControlNet Input: Pose of a person) Prompt: "An ancient warrior in battle armor, dynamic pose, fantasy art style, epic lighting."
</CodeBlock>
