## Mastering Prompts for GPT-4o Image

Prompting is crucial in all modes, but the focus shifts depending on whether you are creating, editing, or customizing. GPT-4o models are known for strong prompt interpretation and respond well to descriptive, clear language.

### Prompt Writing Basics: Subject, Context, and Style

A good starting point for any prompt is to define the core elements:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Subject" icon="user">
    The main object, person, animal, or scenery.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context/Background" icon="map">
    The environment or setting for the subject.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Style" icon="palette">
    The artistic style (e.g., painting, photograph, sketch, or more specific styles).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

After establishing these basics, refine your prompt by adding more details through iteration until the generated image aligns with your vision.

### General Prompting Principles:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific and Detailed" icon="pencil">
    Employ descriptive language, detailed adjectives, and adverbs to paint a clear picture for Imagen.
    *Example:* Instead of "a park," try "A park in the spring next to a lake, the sun sets across the lake, golden hour, red wildflowers."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Natural Language" icon="comments">
    Formulate prompts using descriptive sentences, as you would describe an image to another person.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider Negative Prompts" icon="ban">
    Use negative prompts to steer away from unwanted elements (Note: support varies by model).
  </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Prompt Enhancement" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    For models supporting prompt enhancement (like `imagen-3.0-generate-002`), a shorter prompt can be automatically expanded for potentially better results. This is enabled by default.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Prompting for Specific Modes/Tools:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create Mode" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Focus on fully describing the desired image from scratch, combining subject, context, and style with rich details.
    *Example:* "A futuristic cityscape at sunset, high angle view, digital painting, vibrant colors."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Edit Mode (Draw Mask)" icon="brush">
    Describe what you want to appear *within the masked area*. Focus on the object or scene you want to generate and how it should blend with the existing image. For best results, use a description of the masked area. Avoid single-word prompts.
    *Example:* (Mask over a blank wall) Prompt: "A vibrant graffiti mural covering the wall."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Edit Mode (Maskless Editing)" icon="wand-sparkles">
    Describe the desired changes to the image in natural language. The AI will interpret your instructions and apply the edits without a mask.
    *Example:* (Input Image: Photo of a car) Prompt: "Change the car to red."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Edit Mode (Reference Images)" icon="object-group">
    Describe the desired image, indicating how the AI should draw inspiration from the reference image(s). You can reference specific images if using multiple.
    *Example:* (Reference Image 1: A character, Reference Image 2: A scene) Prompt: "Generate a portrait of the person from image1 standing in the setting from image2."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Edit Mode (Outpainting)" icon="expand">
    Describe the content you want to appear in the *expanded areas* around the original image. You can provide an empty string to create the edited images, but a description of the masked area is recommended for best results.
    *Example:* (Outpainting around a portrait) Prompt: "A lush forest extending around the person."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Edit Mode (Product Image)" icon="box">
    Describe the desired *background* or *environment* for the product.
    *Example:* (Input: Product image) Prompt: "Place the product on a wooden table in a sunny cafe."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Customize Mode (Subject)" icon="user">
    Describe the desired image, referencing the subject from your input image. Use the format `[referenceId]` to refer to the subject image(s).
    *Example:* (Input: Subject Image with referenceId 1) Prompt: "Generate an image of the person [1] as a knight in shining armor." (Referencing the subject with `[1]`).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Customize Mode (Style)" icon="palette">
    Describe the desired image content, indicating it should be in the style of your input image. Use the format `[referenceId]` to refer to the style image.
    *Example:* (Input: Style Image with referenceId 1) Prompt: "Generate an image of a cat sitting on a chair in the style of image [1]."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Customize Mode (ControlNet)" icon="vector-square">
    Your prompt describes the *content* and *style* of the image, while the ControlNet image provides the structural guide. Ensure your prompt aligns with the structural guidance (e.g., edges, pose) provided by the ControlNet image.
    *Example:* (Input: Control Image - Canny edges of a building) Prompt: "A beautiful watercolor painting of an ancient castle at sunset."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Advanced Prompting Techniques:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Generating Text in Images" icon="font">
    GPT-4o can add text to images.
    *   **Iterate:** You may need multiple attempts to get the desired text appearance and placement.
    *   **Keep it Short:** Limit text to 25 characters or less.
    *   **Multiple Phrases:** Experiment with 2-3 distinct phrases.
    *   **Guide Placement:** While placement can vary, you can attempt to guide it in the prompt.
    *   **Inspire Font Style/Size:** Specify general font styles or size indications (small, medium, large).
    *Example:* "A poster with the text 'Summerland' in bold font as a title, underneath this text is the slogan 'Summer never felt so good'."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prompt Parameterization" icon="code">
    For API/SDK use, you can parameterize prompts with placeholders like `{logo_style}` to be filled by user inputs in an interface.
