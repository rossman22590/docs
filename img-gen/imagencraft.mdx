## Mastering Prompts for ImagenCraft

Prompting is crucial in all modes, but the focus shifts depending on whether you are creating, editing, or customizing. Imagen models are known for strong prompt interpretation and respond well to descriptive, clear language.

### Prompt Writing Basics: Subject, Context, and Style

A good starting point for any prompt is to define the core elements:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Subject" icon="user">
    The main object, person, animal, or scenery.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context/Background" icon="map">
    The environment or setting for the subject.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Style" icon="palette">
    The artistic style (e.g., painting, photograph, sketch, or more specific styles).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

After establishing these basics, refine your prompt by adding more details through iteration until the generated image aligns with your vision.

### General Prompting Principles:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific and Detailed" icon="pencil">
    Employ descriptive language, detailed adjectives, and adverbs to paint a clear picture for Imagen.
    *Example:* Instead of "a park," try "A park in the spring next to a lake, the sun sets across the lake, golden hour, red wildflowers."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Natural Language" icon="comments">
    Formulate prompts using descriptive sentences, as you would describe an image to another person.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Consider Negative Prompts" icon="ban">
    Use negative prompts to steer away from unwanted elements (Note: support varies by model).
  </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Prompt Enhancement" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    For models supporting prompt enhancement (like `imagen-3.0-generate-002`), a shorter prompt can be automatically expanded for potentially better results. This is enabled by default.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Prompting for Specific Modes/Tools:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create Mode" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Focus on fully describing the desired image from scratch, combining subject, context, and style with rich details.
    *Example:* "A futuristic cityscape at sunset, high angle view, digital painting, vibrant colors."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Edit Mode (Inpainting Insertion)" icon="brush">
    Describe what you want to appear *within the masked area*. Focus on the object or scene you want to generate and how it should blend with the existing image. For best results, use a description of the masked area. Avoid single-word prompts.
    *Example:* (Mask over a blank wall) Prompt: "A vibrant graffiti mural covering the wall."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Edit Mode (Remove Object)" icon="eraser">
    When removing objects, prompts are typically omitted or left empty. The mask defines what is removed, and the AI fills based on the surrounding context.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Edit Mode (Outpainting)" icon="expand">
    Describe the content you want to appear in the *expanded areas* around the original image. You can provide an empty string to create the edited images, but a description of the masked area is recommended for best results.
    *Example:* (Outpainting around a portrait) Prompt: "A lush forest extending around the person."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Edit Mode (Product Image)" icon="box">
    Describe the desired *background* or *environment* for the product.
    *Example:* (Input: Product image) Prompt: "Place the product on a wooden table in a sunny cafe."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Customize Mode (Subject)" icon="user">
    Describe the desired image, referencing the subject from your input image. Use the format `[referenceId]` to refer to the subject image(s).
    *Example:* (Input: Subject Image with referenceId 1) Prompt: "Generate an image of the person [1] as a knight in shining armor." (Referencing the subject with `[1]`).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Customize Mode (Style)" icon="palette">
    Describe the desired image content, indicating it should be in the style of your input image. Use the format `[referenceId]` to refer to the style image.
    *Example:* (Input: Style Image with referenceId 1) Prompt: "Generate an image of a cat sitting on a chair in the style of image [1]."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Customize Mode (ControlNet)" icon="vector-square">
    Your prompt describes the *content* and *style* of the image, while the ControlNet image provides the structural guide. Ensure your prompt aligns with the structural guidance (e.g., edges, pose) provided by the ControlNet image.
    *Example:* (Input: Control Image - Canny edges of a building) Prompt: "A beautiful watercolor painting of an ancient castle at sunset."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Advanced Prompting Techniques:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Generating Text in Images" icon="font">
    Imagen 3 can add text to images.

    *   **Multiple Phrases:** Experiment with 2-3 distinct phrases.
    *   **Guide Placement:** While placement can vary, you can attempt to guide it in the prompt.
    *   **Inspire Font Style/Size:** Specify general font styles or size indications (small, medium, large).
    *Example:* "A poster with the text 'Summerland' in bold font as a title, underneath this text is the slogan 'Summer never felt so good'."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prompt Parameterization" icon="code">
    For API/SDK use, you can parameterize prompts with placeholders like `{logo_style}` to be filled by user inputs in an interface.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Using Specific Styles" icon="palette">
