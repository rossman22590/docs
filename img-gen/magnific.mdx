# Pixio Magnific Upscaler - User Guide

The Pixio Magnific Upscaler allows you to generate stunning, high-quality images by customizing various parameters directly in the UI. Below is an overview of each setting to help you understand and fine-tune your results.

## Parameters

### Prompt

**Type:** Text input (Required)

**Description:**
Enter a descriptive prompt that guides the AI in creating your desired image. For example:

* "A serene landscape with rolling hills and a sunrise"

* "A futuristic city skyline at night, with neon lights"

The prompt sets the visual direction and thematic elements of the final image.

***

### Resolution

**Type:** Dropdown
**Default:** `2k`
**Options:** `2k`, `4k`

**Description:**
Select the resolution of the generated image. Higher resolutions like `4k` produce more detailed images, but may take longer to process.

### Aspect Ratio

**Type:** Dropdown
**Default:** `square_1_1`
**Options:**

* `square_1_1` (1:1)

* `classic_4_3` (4:3)

* `traditional_3_4` (3:4)

* `widescreen_16_9` (16:9)

Change the shape of the image by adjusting its aspect ratio. For example, choose `widescreen_16_9` for a cinematic look or `portrait_2_3` for a vertical orientation.

***

### Realism

**Type:** Toggle (On/Off)
**Default:** On

**Description:**
Enable this option to give your generated image a more realistic, less "AI-generated" appearance. This is ideal for photographs or scenes you want to look natural. If you’re aiming for a more fantastical image or want strict adherence to imaginative prompts, consider turning it off.

***

### Creative Detailing

**Type:** Slider (0 to 100)
**Default:** 33

**Description:**
Adjust the level of micro-detail in your image.

* Lower values: Cleaner, simpler results.

* Higher values: More intricate and possibly more "artsy" details.

Experiment with different values to achieve the right balance between clarity and complexity.

***

### Engine

**Type:** Dropdown
**Default:** `Automatic`
**Options:**

* `Automatic` (Let the system pick the best mode)

* `Illusio` (Softer illustrations, landscapes, and nature)

* `Sharpy` (More realistic, detailed, slightly grainy, ideal for photographs)

* `Sparkle` (A balanced engine that blends realism with a touch of softness)

**Description:**
Select an engine based on the style and subject matter of your image. Each engine has a unique "look and feel," so try different engines to see which one best suits your creative vision.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start Simple:** Begin with a straightforward prompt and lower creative detailing. Gradually increase complexity to refine your vision.

2. **Experiment:** Don’t hesitate to try different aspect ratios, resolutions, and engines. Each parameter can significantly change the final look.

3. **Use Realism Wisely:** Turn realism on for lifelike scenes and off for more fantastical or stylized art.

4. **Refine Iteratively:** If you enable fixed generation, you can tweak your prompt or other parameters step-by-step, observing subtle changes.

By understanding and adjusting these parameters, you can unlock endless possibilities with the Pixio Magnific Upscaler, creating images that are truly unique to your style and imagination.
