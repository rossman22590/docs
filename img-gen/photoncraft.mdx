## Mastering Prompts for PhotonCraft

PhotonCraft, powered by Luma's models, is designed as a **collaborative tool**. You don't necessarily need overly complex or descriptive prompts to start. Think of your initial prompt as the beginning of a conversation, an idea you'll refine and expand upon. Photon models excel at **interpreting natural language** and allow for **iterative editing**, making the prompting process more intuitive and less rigid.

### Prompting Philosophy & Techniques

    *Example:* Instead of a highly detailed scene, start with "A bustling London street at golden hour."
  </Accordion>
    
  <Accordion title="Mix Realism and Creativity" icon="palette">
    Photon models handle both photorealistic and imaginative concepts with ease. Don't hesitate to blend realistic settings with creative elements.
