###  How to Use PixCraft
Follow these simple steps to get started with PixCraft and create AI-generated images that match your creative vision.

<AccordionGroup> <Accordion title="Step 1: Input Your Prompt" icon="keyboard"> Begin by typing a **descriptive prompt** into the prompt bar. This could be anything from "a sunset over a mountain" to "a futuristic cityscape." The AI will use your text to generate visually accurate interpretations. </Accordion> <Accordion title="Step 2: Customize Your Settings" icon="sliders"> Click on the **Edit tab** next to the prompt bar to access customization options. Here, you can adjust: - **Version**: Select the AI model version for generation. - **Aspect Ratio**: Choose the shape of your image. - **Quality**: Adjust the level of detail. - **Style**: Pick a style for the image (e.g., realistic, abstract). - **Chaos**: Control how much variation and randomness is included in the output. </Accordion> <Accordion title="Step 3: Select an Enhancement Option" icon="fill-drip"> Before generating your images, choose between **raw** or **tile** enhancement options. The **raw** option keeps the image unaltered, while the **tile** option enhances its composition for a more intricate final result. </Accordion> <Accordion title="Step 4: Generate Your Images" icon="bolt"> After adjusting your settings, click the **Generate** button. PixCraft will create **three image variations** based on your prompt, delivering results within minutes. </Accordion> <Accordion title="Step 5: Review and Select Your Output" icon="eye"> Once the images are ready, you’ll be able to **review each one** and select the version that best fits your initial concept.

###  Tips for Better Results
<AccordionGroup> <Accordion title="Be Specific with Prompts" icon="pen"> The more detailed and specific your prompt, the more likely PixCraft will generate accurate results. Try including key elements like **mood**, **color palette**, or **specific objects** to guide the AI’s creativity. </Accordion> <Accordion title="Experiment with Settings" icon="flask"> Don’t be afraid to adjust different settings in the **Edit tab**. Changing the **chaos** level or **style** can produce dramatically different results, offering new creative perspectives on the same prompt. </Accordion> <Accordion title="Consider Enhancement Options" icon="stars"> Choosing between **raw** or **tile** enhancement options impacts the final look of your images. **Tile** may add complexity and structure, while **raw** provides a more organic output.
