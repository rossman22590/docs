## Prompting Guide and Strategies

Mastering Pixio Chat starts with one fundamental principle: **Describe the scene, don't just list keywords.** The model's core strength is its deep language understanding. A narrative, descriptive paragraph will almost always produce a better, more coherent image than a list of disconnected words.

### Prompts for Generating Images
