## Image Remixing

Transform existing images using AI-powered remixing:

1. **Upload a Base Image**: Choose an image with elements you want to keep or modify.
2. **Craft a Remix Prompt**: Describe the changes you want while referencing the original image.
3. **Balance Old and New**: Specify which elements to keep, change, or add.
4. **Adjust Image Weight**: Control the influence of the original image on the final result.

### Remix Prompt Example

  <CodeBlock title="Remix Prompt">
    ```plaintext
    Transform this modern cityscape into a futuristic cyberpunk scene. Add neon signs, 
    holographic billboards, and flying vehicles. Keep the basic layout of buildings but 
    enhance them with high-tech elements and glowing energy lines. Add a large, red 
    cybernetic moon in the sky. Style: digital art with a dark, moody atmosphere.
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
