## How QRCraft Uses Stable Diffusion

QRCraft utilizes Stable Diffusion in an innovative way to create QR codes:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="qrcode" title="QR Code Generation">
    First, a standard QR code is generated based on the provided URL.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="brain" title="Prompt Interpretation">
    The AI model interprets the given prompt to understand the desired artistic style and elements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="images" title="Image Synthesis">
    Stable Diffusion then generates an image that incorporates both the functional QR code pattern and the artistic elements described in the prompt.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="gears" title="Optimization">
    The generated image is optimized to ensure the QR code remains scannable while maintaining its artistic integrity.
  </Accordion>

This process results in a QR code that's not just functional, but also a piece of digital art.
