## Mastering Prompts for SanaCraft

Crafting effective prompts is key to unlocking SanaCraft's full potential. The NVIDIA Sana model excels at interpreting detailed descriptions and translating them into vivid visuals.

### Prompt Crafting Techniques

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific and Descriptive" icon="pencil">
    Paint a clear picture with your words. Detail the subject, setting, actions, and key visual elements.
    
    *Example:* Instead of "a dog," try "a fluffy golden retriever puppy playing in a sunlit meadow."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Define Style and Mood" icon="palette">
    Specify the artistic style (e.g., photorealistic, anime, digital art) and the desired emotional tone or atmosphere.
    
    *Example:* "a serene landscape in the style of a watercolor painting, with a calm and peaceful mood."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include Lighting Details" icon="sun">
    Describe the lighting conditions to add depth and realism.
    
    *Example:* "lit by the warm glow of a setting sun," or "under harsh, dramatic studio lighting."
  </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Utilize Negative Prompts" icon="ban">
    Actively use the negative prompt field to specify anything you *don't* want to appear in the image. This is crucial for refining results.
    
    *Example:* "ugly, blurry, low quality, distorted, text, watermark."
  </Accordion>
