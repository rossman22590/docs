## Using Stable Diffusion 3

To get the best results from Stable Diffusion 3, follow these steps and best practices:

### Step 1: Enter Your Prompt

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Crafting Effective Prompts" icon="pencil-alt">
    - Use detailed, descriptive language
    - Include specific style references if desired
    - SD3 can handle much longer prompts than previous versions (up to 10,000 characters)
    
    Example: "A hyperrealistic portrait of an elderly Inuit woman in her 80s with deep wrinkles, weathered skin, and wise, piercing dark eyes. Her silver hair is braided and adorned with traditional bone beads. She's wearing a fur-trimmed parka. Capture the soft, golden light of the Arctic midnight sun reflecting in her eyes and on her skin."

### Step 2: Adjust Settings

Click on the settings button to access additional options:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Negative Prompt" icon="ban">
    Specify elements you don't want in the image. Note: SD3 wasn't trained with negative prompts, so their effect may be limited.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Aspect Ratio" icon="crop">
    Choose from preset ratios like 1:1, 16:9, 4:3, etc. SD3 performs best at around 1 megapixel resolution.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Inference Steps" icon="stairs">
    Recommended: 28 steps. More steps can lead to more detailed images but increase generation time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Guidance Scale" icon="sliders">
    Recommended: 3.5 to 4.5. Controls how closely the image adheres to the prompt.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Optional Image Input

You can upload an image to guide the generation process:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Image-to-Image Generation" icon="images">
    - Upload a base image
    - Adjust the "Prompt Strength" to control how much the original image influences the result
  </Accordion>
