# Stable Diffusion 3.5: Prompting and Options Guide

Stable Diffusion 3.5 offers advanced AI image generation capabilities. This guide will help you understand how to craft effective prompts and use the available options to create stunning images.

## Crafting Effective Prompts

The prompt is the most crucial input for generating images with Stable Diffusion 3.5. Here are some tips for writing effective prompts:

1. **Be Specific and Descriptive**: Provide detailed descriptions of what you want to see in the image.
2. **Use Natural Language**: Write as if you're describing the image to another person.
3. **Specify Visual Elements**: Include details about colors, textures, lighting, and composition.
4. **Mention Styles or Artists**: Reference specific art styles or artists to guide the aesthetic.
5. **Balance Detail and Creativity**: While being specific, leave some room for AI interpretation.

Example prompt: A hyperrealistic close-up portrait of an elderly Inuit woman in her 80s, with deep wrinkles,
weathered skin, and wise, piercing dark eyes. Her silver hair is braided and adorned with
traditional bone beads. She's wearing a fur-trimmed parka. Capture the soft, golden light
of the Arctic midnight sun reflecting in her eyes and on her skin.

### Seed

<Accordion title="Seed" icon="seedling">
  A number that initializes the random generation process.
  - Optional: Leave blank for a random seed each time

## Tips for Best Results

- Experiment with different prompt phrasings to see how they affect the output.
- Try various combinations of inference steps and guidance scale to find the ideal balance for your needs.
- Use the seed option to create variations of an image you like by slightly modifying other parameters.
