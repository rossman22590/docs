### Introducing "Become Image" - A Specialized Feature for Human Faces in Pixio's Upscaler

Pixio's Upscaler introduces "Become Image," a feature akin to Style Transfer but with a distinct focus on human faces, making it an ideal choice for those looking to transform portraits into artistic masterpieces. "Become Image" excels in blending the delicate nuances of human expressions with the aesthetic styles of various art forms, such as oil paintings, sketches, or watercolors, offering a more specialized approach for personal photos and portraits.

### How "Become Image" Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Your Base Image" icon="upload">
    Start by selecting a portrait or any image featuring human faces that you wish to transform. This image will serve as the canvas for your artistic reinvention.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Your Reference Image" icon="image">
    Next, upload a reference image that embodies the style you aim to adopt. This could be an image of an oil painting, a charcoal sketch, or any art form that captures the essence you desire to emulate.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust the 'Become Strength' Slider" icon="sliders-h">
    The feature includes a slider to control the "Become Strength," which determines the intensity of the style application from your reference image onto the base image. Sliding towards a higher value will more profoundly infuse your base image with the characteristics of the reference style.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Transform and Download" icon="magic">
    With your settings in place, initiate the transformation process. "Become Image" will artfully merge the style of your reference image with the base image, while preserving the integrity of the human faces. Once satisfied with the result, you can download your newly created artistic rendition.
