        3. Lighting description (e.g., "illuminated by vibrant neon signs")
        4. Mood or atmosphere (e.g., "creating a moody, cyberpunk ambiance")
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Example Prompts" icon="list-ul">
        - "A young woman bathed in warm, golden sunlight filtering through autumn leaves, creating a soft, dreamy atmosphere in a forest clearing."
        - "An elderly craftsman in his workshop, lit by a single, strong light source from the left, casting dramatic shadows and highlighting the texture of his weathered hands."
        - "A fashion model on a rooftop at twilight, with the fading sunlight creating a warm backlight and the city lights providing a cool fill light, resulting in a striking high-contrast look."
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

    </Frame>
    
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Negative Prompt" icon="ban">
        Specify elements to avoid in your generated image. This helps refine the output by explicitly stating what you don't want to see.
        Example: "oversaturated colors, lens flare, overexposed highlights"
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Steps" icon="shoe-prints">
        Controls the number of denoising steps (1-100). Higher values often result in more detailed and refined outputs but increase processing time.
        Recommended range: 20-50 for a good balance of quality and speed.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="CFG (Classifier-Free Guidance) Scale" icon="balance-scale">
        Adjusts how closely the generated image adheres to your prompt (1-32). Higher values produce results that more strictly follow the prompt but may sacrifice some natural variation.
        Recommended range: 7-15 for most use cases.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Highres Scale" icon="expand-arrows-alt">
        Determines the scale factor for high-resolution processing (1-3). Higher values can improve detail but may introduce artifacts if set too high.
        Recommended: Start at 1.5 and adjust as needed.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Light Source" icon="lightbulb">
        Specifies the primary direction of light. Options include:
        - None: Let the AI determine based on your prompt
        - Left/Right: Creates dramatic side lighting
        - Top: Simulates overhead lighting, good for outdoor scenes
        - Bottom: Produces an unusual, potentially eerie effect
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Output Quality" icon="star">
        Controls the final image quality (0-100). Higher values result in better image quality but larger file sizes.
        Recommended: 80-95 for a good balance of quality and file size.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate and Analyze" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Initiate the relighting process and carefully review the results.
    
    <Tip>
      The generation process typically takes less than a minute. Use this time to prepare for your analysis!
    </Tip>
    
    When reviewing your relit image, consider:
    - How well does the new lighting match your prompt?
    - Are shadows and highlights natural and consistent?
    - Does the overall mood align with your vision?
    - Are there any artifacts or unrealistic areas?
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Refine and Perfect" icon="sliders-h">
