# Style Transfer

### Introducing Style Transfer in Pixio's Upscaler

Pixio's Upscaler now boasts an innovative feature known as Style Transfer, designed to blend creativity with technology by merging the aesthetics of one image with the structure of another. This cutting-edge feature empowers users to transform their base images by adopting the artistic style of another, creating visually stunning results that combine the best of both worlds.

### How Style Transfer Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Your Base Image" icon="image">
    Begin by uploading the image you wish to transform. This image will serve as the foundation for the style transfer process.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Input a prompt" icon="comment">
    You can add a prompt to supplement your images. This prompt does not have to be too crazy, a simple prompt does the job!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initiate Style Transfer" icon="shirt">
    Look for the "Use Style Transfer" option and upload the image whose style you wish to emulate. Images with clear edges and distinct styles yield the best results, allowing for a more seamless and effective transfer.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust Style and Structure Strengths" icon="sliders">
    The feature includes two adjustable sliders for fine-tuning the outcome:

    - **Style Strength**: Determines the extent to which the artistic style of the second image is applied to your base image. Sliding towards a higher value increases the influence of the chosen style.

    - **Structure Strength**: Controls how much of the original structure of the base image is preserved during the style transfer. A higher value maintains more of the base image's original form.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upscale and Enhance" icon="expand">
    Once you've set your preferences, proceed to upscale your image. This step not only applies the style transfer but also enhances the resolution, ensuring your creation is both beautiful and sharp.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Download Your Masterpiece" icon="download">
    After the upscaling and style transfer process is complete, you can download your newly transformed image, ready for sharing, printing, or further editing.
  </Step>
