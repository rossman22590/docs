# Advanced Tutorials

These step-by-step tutorials demonstrate how to use Machine for complex, real-world tasks. Each tutorial provides detailed instructions, examples, and best practices.

## Data Analysis Workflow

This tutorial walks through using Machine to analyze a dataset, generate insights, and create visualizations.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Your Data">
    Start by uploading your dataset to Machine. Supported formats include CSV, Excel, JSON, and SQL databases.
    
    ```
    You: "I need to analyze this customer feedback dataset"
    Machine: "I can help with that. Would you like to upload the dataset now?"
    ```
    
    After uploading, Machine will automatically examine the data structure and provide an initial summary.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Clean and Transform">
    Next, clean your data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
    
    ```
    You: "The dataset has some missing values and outliers we need to address"
    Machine: "I notice there are 23 missing values in the 'customer_age' column and 12 potential outliers in 'purchase_amount'. Would you like me to:
    1. Remove rows with missing values
    2. Impute missing values using the mean/median
    3. Handle these issues another way?"
    ```
    
    Machine will suggest transformations based on data quality issues it detects, but you maintain control over how to proceed.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Exploratory Analysis">
    Have Machine perform initial analysis to understand patterns and relationships in the data.
    
    ```
    You: "What are the main patterns you notice in this data?"
    Machine: "Based on my analysis, here are the key insights:
    - Customer satisfaction correlates strongly with response time (r=0.72)
    - The 25-34 age group represents 42% of your customer base
    - Product category A has the highest return rate at 8.3%
    
    Would you like me to generate visualizations for these insights?"
    ```
    
    Machine can identify correlations, trends, clusters, and outliers automatically.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Visualize Results">
    Create visual representations of your data insights.
    
    ```
    You: "Yes, please create visualizations for the key insights"
    Machine: "I'll create several visualizations to highlight these patterns. Which format would you prefer for the final report: PDF, interactive dashboard, or presentation slides?"
    ```
    
    Machine will generate appropriate visualizations based on data types and relationships, including:
    - Bar charts for categorical comparisons
    - Scatter plots for correlations
    - Time series for trends
    - Heatmaps for complex relationships
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate Recommendations">
    Finally, have Machine provide actionable recommendations based on the analysis.
    
    ```
    You: "Based on this analysis, what actions should we consider taking?"
    Machine: "Based on the data, here are my recommendations:
    1. Reduce response times for the 25-34 demographic to improve satisfaction
    2. Investigate quality issues in Product Category A to address high return rates
    3. Expand inventory for high-margin products showing consistent growth
    
    Would you like me to prepare a detailed action plan for any of these recommendations?"
