# Using External APIs with Machine

Machine can connect to virtually any external API using its built-in Python and command-line capabilities. This guide explains how to use these features to expand Machine's functionality by connecting to external services.

## API Integration Capabilities

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Python Requests" icon="python">
    Machine can execute Python code that uses the requests library to call external APIs.

## Basic Python API Example

Here's a simple example of using Python to connect to an external API within Machine:

```python
import requests

# Make a GET request to a public API
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Process the JSON response
    data = response.json()
    print(f"Retrieved {len(data)} records")
    
    # You can now use this data in your workflow
    for item in data[:5]:  # Show first 5 items
        print(item['name'])
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
```

Simply paste this code into Machine, adjust the URL and parsing logic for your specific API, and run it.

## Using Curl Commands

If you prefer using curl commands, Machine supports those as well:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.example.com/data -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Authentication Methods

Machine supports various authentication methods for APIs:

### API Key Authentication

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'X-API-Key': 'your_api_key_here'
}

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data', headers=headers)
```

### OAuth Authentication

```python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your_oauth_token_here'
}

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data', headers=headers)
```

### Basic Authentication

```python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    'https://api.example.com/data',
    auth=('username', 'password')
)
```

## POST Requests with Data

Sending data to an API:

```python
import requests

data = {
    'name': 'New Item',
    'description': 'This is a new item created via API'
}

response = requests.post('https://api.example.com/items', json=data)

if response.status_code == 201:
    print("Item created successfully!")
    print(response.json())
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
```

## Common API Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Data Retrieval" icon="database">
    Fetch data from external sources to enhance your analysis or combine with your own data.
    
    ```python
    # Example: Getting weather data
    import requests
    
    city = "New York"
    api_key = "your_weather_api_key"
    
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key={api_key}&q={city}")
    weather_data = response.json()
    
    print(f"Current temperature in {city}: {weather_data['current']['temp_c']}Â°C")
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Content Generation" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Use external AI services alongside Machine for specialized content generation.
    
    ```python
    # Example: Generating an image description using an external API
    import requests
    
    image_url = "https://example.com/image.jpg"
    vision_api_key = "your_vision_api_key"
    
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {vision_api_key}"}
    data = {"image_url": image_url}
    
    response = requests.post("https://api.vision-service.com/analyze", headers=headers, json=data)
    description = response.json()["description"]
    
    print(f"Image description: {description}")
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data Transformation" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Convert data between formats using specialized APIs.
    
    ```python
    # Example: Converting currency
    import requests
    
    amount = 100
    from_currency = "USD"
    to_currency = "EUR"
    api_key = "your_exchange_api_key"
    
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.exchangerate.host/convert?from={from_currency}&to={to_currency}&amount={amount}&api_key={api_key}")
    result = response.json()
    
    print(f"{amount} {from_currency} = {result['result']} {to_currency}")
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

When using external APIs with Machine, follow these best practices:

1. **Security**: Never hardcode sensitive credentials directly in your code. Consider using environment variables or secure storage.

2. **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of API rate limits. Add delays between requests if making multiple calls to avoid being blocked.

3. **Error Handling**: Always implement proper error handling to manage API failures gracefully.

4. **Data Validation**: Validate the data received from external APIs before using it in critical operations.

5. **Caching**: Consider caching API responses for frequently accessed data to improve performance.

## Limitations and Considerations

- Machine has network connectivity to most common APIs but may have restrictions for security reasons
- Some APIs may have CORS or other security restrictions that prevent direct access
- For very large datasets, consider pagination or streaming techniques
- Machine operates within its security sandbox, so some system-level operations might be restricted

<Info>
Remember that when using external APIs, you're responsible for complying with each service's terms of use and data handling requirements.
