# Browser Automation

Machine's browser automation capabilities allow it to navigate the web on your behalf, extracting information and performing actions across websites through simple conversational commands.

## Overview

Browser automation enables Machine to act as your digital navigator, visiting websites, interacting with web elements, and gathering informationâ€”all while you guide it through natural conversation.

## Key Capabilities

### Website Navigation

Machine can visit websites and navigate through them based on your instructions:

```
You: "Visit example.com and go to their products page"
Machine: "I'm navigating to example.com... Now I'm on their products page. I can see they have categories for electronics, clothing, and home goods. Would you like me to explore any of these categories?"
```

### Data Extraction

Machine can extract specific information or entire datasets from websites:

```
You: "Find the top 10 most popular products on the site and create a spreadsheet with their names, prices, and ratings"
Machine: "I'm scanning the products page... I've identified the top 10 products based on the 'Popular' badge. I'll extract their details and create a spreadsheet for you."
```

### Form Filling & Submission

Machine can complete forms and submit information:

```
You: "Fill out their contact form to request more information about their enterprise solutions"
Machine: "I'll help you fill out the contact form. What name should I use? And what email address would you like them to respond to?"
```

### Multi-step Workflows

Machine can perform complex sequences of actions across multiple websites:

```
You: "I need to compare prices for this product across three different retailers"
Machine: "I'll search for this product on Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart to compare prices. This will take a moment..."
```

## Permissions & Ethical Use

Machine always requires your explicit permission before accessing any website or performing actions. It's designed to respect:

- **Website Terms of Service**: Machine will not attempt to circumvent website restrictions or access protected content without proper authorization.
- **Rate Limiting**: Machine follows appropriate request rates to avoid overloading websites.
- **Data Privacy**: Information extracted from websites is handled according to our privacy policy and used only for your specific tasks.

<Warning>
Browser automation should only be used for legitimate purposes. Do not use Machine to scrape websites that prohibit such activities, attempt to circumvent paywalls, or violate terms of service.
</Warning>

## Limitations

While powerful, Machine's browser automation capabilities have some limitations:

- **CAPTCHA & Anti-Bot Measures**: Some websites employ measures specifically designed to prevent automation.
- **Dynamic Content**: Highly dynamic websites with complex JavaScript may present challenges.
- **Login Requirements**: Some sites may require user authentication that Machine cannot complete without your direct involvement.
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Content that's region-restricted may not be accessible.

## Getting Started with Browser Automation

To use Machine's browser automation features, simply describe the web-based task you need help with. For example:

- "Can you check the current price of Product X on these three websites?"
- "I need information about upcoming events in my city this weekend."
- "Help me find the best deals on flights from New York to London for next month."

Machine will guide you through the process, asking for clarification when needed and keeping you informed of its progress.
