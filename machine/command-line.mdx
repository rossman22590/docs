# Command-Line Functionality

Machine can execute command-line operations on your behalf, enabling powerful system automation through simple conversations. This capability allows you to perform complex technical tasks without needing to remember specific command syntax.

## Overview

The command-line functionality serves as a bridge between natural language and system-level operations, allowing you to:

- Run terminal commands without memorizing syntax
- Execute scripts and programs
- Automate system tasks
- Install and configure software
- Manage files and directories at the system level

<Warning>
  Command-line operations can modify your system and files. Machine always asks for confirmation before executing potentially destructive or high-impact commands.
</Warning>

## Available Operations

### File System Operations

Machine can help you manage files and directories through commands like:

```bash
# List directory contents
ls -la ~/Documents

# Find files by pattern
find ~/Documents -name "*.pdf" -mtime -7

# Create directories
mkdir -p ~/Projects/new-project/src

# Move or rename files
mv ~/Downloads/document.pdf ~/Documents/important.pdf
```

### System Information

Retrieve information about your system:

```bash
# System information
uname -a
systeminfo

# Disk usage
df -h
du -sh ~/Documents

# Process monitoring
ps aux | grep "chrome"
top
```

### Network Operations

Perform network diagnostics and operations:

```bash
# Check connectivity
ping google.com

# Network interface information
ifconfig
ipconfig /all

# DNS lookups
nslookup example.com
dig example.com
```

### Package Management

Install and manage software packages:

```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu
apt update && apt install package-name

# For Red Hat/Fedora
dnf install package-name

# For macOS
brew install package-name

# For Windows
choco install package-name
```

### Process Management

Control running processes:

```bash
# Start a process
start program.exe
open application.app

# Stop a process
pkill process-name
taskkill /IM program.exe
```

## Using Command-Line Functionality

### Natural Language Requests

You don't need to know exact commands. Simply describe what you want to accomplish:

```
You: "I need to find all PDF files in my Downloads folder from the last week"
Machine: "I can help with that. I'll use the 'find' command to locate PDF files modified in the last 7 days. Would you like me to run: find ~/Downloads -name '*.pdf' -mtime -7"
```

### Script Creation

Machine can create, explain, and execute scripts:

```
You: "I need a script that backs up my Documents folder to an external drive every day"
Machine: "I'll create a backup script for you. Here's what it will do:
1. Check if your external drive is connected
2. Create a timestamped backup folder
3. Use rsync to copy only changed files
4. Log the backup status

Would you like me to create this script now?"
```

### Automation Workflows

Create complex automation workflows through conversation:

```
You: "I want to set up a workflow that downloads data from our website analytics, processes it with Python, and emails me a weekly report"
Machine: "I'll help you create that automation. Let me break this down into steps:
1. Use curl to download analytics data
2. Process it with a Python script
3. Create a report document
4. Send it via email
5. Schedule this with cron/Task Scheduler

Would you like me to help you implement each step?"
```

## Security Considerations

When using command-line functionality, Machine follows these security principles:

### Permission Requirements

- Machine only executes commands with your current user permissions
- Elevated privileges (sudo/Administrator) are clearly indicated before execution
- You must explicitly approve commands requiring elevated privileges

### Command Review

- All commands are shown to you before execution
- Potentially destructive operations are highlighted with warnings
- Machine explains complex commands in plain language

### Execution Contexts

- By default, commands run in a secure execution context
- File system access is limited to your user directories unless explicitly expanded
- Network operations follow strict security policies

## Best Practices

Follow these guidelines for optimal and secure use of command-line functionality:

1. **Review commands carefully** before approving execution
2. **Start simple** with basic commands before attempting complex operations
3. **Use descriptive requests** to help Machine understand your goals
4. **Ask for explanations** if you don't understand what a command does
5. **Create scripts** for recurring operations rather than executing complex commands repeatedly

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Windows

- PowerShell and Command Prompt commands are both supported
- Some operations may require Administrator privileges
- UNC paths are supported for network operations

### macOS/Linux

- Bash, Zsh, and other common shells are supported
- Environment variables are preserved between commands
- File permissions follow standard Unix models

<Info>
  For advanced command-line operations or custom scripts, you can provide Machine with specific syntax or ask it to optimize commands for your particular environment.
