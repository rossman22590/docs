## File Operations

### Creating Files

Ask Machine to create new files by describing what you need:

```
You: "I need a spreadsheet to track my monthly expenses"
Machine: "I can create an expense tracking spreadsheet for you. Would you like me to include categories like housing, transportation, food, etc.?"
```

```
You: "Create a Python script that sorts files in a directory by type"
Machine: "I'll create a Python script that organizes files by their extensions. Do you want it to move the files into separate folders or just display the sorted list?"
```

### Editing Files

Machine can help you edit existing files:

```
You: "Update my resume to include my new position at Acme Corp"
Machine: "I'll help you update your resume. Could you upload the current version so I can make the changes?"
```

```
You: "Add a new section to my project documentation about the API endpoints"
Machine: "I'll add an API endpoints section to your documentation. What specific endpoints should I include, and do you want examples for each one?"
```

### File Conversion

Convert between different file formats:

```
You: "Convert this CSV file to JSON"
Machine: "I'll convert your CSV data to JSON format. Would you like me to create a nested structure or keep it as a flat array of objects?"
```

```
You: "Turn this markdown document into a PDF with proper formatting"
Machine: "I'll convert your markdown to a nicely formatted PDF. Would you like me to include a table of contents and apply any specific styling?"
```

### File Analysis

Extract insights and information from your files:

```
You: "Summarize the key points from this research paper"
Machine: "I'll analyze the research paper and extract the main findings, methodology, and conclusions. Would you like me to focus on any specific aspects?"
```

```
You: "Analyze this dataset and tell me what patterns you notice"
Machine: "I'll analyze your dataset for patterns and trends. I can create visualizations, calculate statistics, and identify correlations. Any specific insights you're looking for?"
```

## Workspace Management

### Organizing Files

Machine helps you keep your files organized:

```
You: "Help me organize my project files into a logical folder structure"
Machine: "I'll help organize your project files. Based on what I see, I recommend creating folders for documentation, source code, resources, and tests. Would that work for you?"
```

### Batch Operations

Perform operations across multiple files:

```
You: "Rename all the image files in this folder to follow the pattern project-image-001.jpg"
Machine: "I'll rename your image files with the pattern 'project-image-001.jpg', 'project-image-002.jpg', etc. There are 24 images. Should I proceed?"
```

## File Sharing & Collaboration

### Sharing Options

Machine provides several ways to share your files:

- **Direct download links**: Share files with anyone via secure links
- **Workspace sharing**: Collaborate with team members in shared workspaces
- **Export to cloud services**: Send files to Google Drive, Dropbox, or other services

```
You: "Share this presentation with my team"
Machine: "How would you like to share the presentation? I can create a direct download link, add it to a shared workspace, or export it to a cloud service like Google Drive."
```

## Best Practices

For optimal file management with Machine:

1. **Be specific with filenames**: Use descriptive names for easier searching and organization

2. **Leverage metadata**: Add tags and descriptions to important files

3. **Use workspaces**: Organize related files into dedicated workspaces for improved context

4. **Regular cleanup**: Schedule periodic reviews of your files to archive or delete unnecessary items

5. **Template creation**: Create templates for frequently used file types

## File Security

Machine protects your files with multiple security measures:

- **Encryption**: All files are encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access controls**: Fine-grained permissions for shared workspaces
- **Virus scanning**: Automatic scanning of all uploaded files
- **Version history**: Recover previous versions of your files if needed
