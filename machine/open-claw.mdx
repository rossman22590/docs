# OpenClaw Gateway

Connect your Machine agents to messaging platforms — Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp — through a single gateway. OpenClaw gives you one place to select an agent, configure channels, and control your gateway.

## Overview

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Select Agent" icon="robot">
    Choose which agent to configure for messaging channels. That agent's instructions and model power all connected channels.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Messaging Channels" icon="comments">
    Connect and manage Telegram, Discord, and WhatsApp from one dashboard. Gateway shows **Active** when ready.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

When the gateway is active, use **Open Gateway UI** to manage your OpenClaw instance and see real-time status.

## Machine Backend Configuration

Before connecting channels, configure how OpenClaw talks to Machine.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Machine CLI" icon="terminal">
    Set the **default model** used by this gateway. Changing it will restart the gateway so the new model takes effect.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="API Key (Optional)" icon="key">
    Only required for certain models. Enter your key in the format `sk-...`. Need a key? Get one from your provider.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Click **Save Machine Config** after updating. The gateway will use these settings for all messaging channels.

## Connecting Messaging Channels

### Telegram

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Telegram and search for @BotFather">
    Create a bot if you don't have one yet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the command /newbot">
    Follow BotFather's instructions to name your bot and choose a username (must end in `bot` or `Bot`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the bot token">
    BotFather provides a token like `1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz`. Copy it fully.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste in OpenClaw">
    In the Telegram section, paste the token and click **Connect Telegram Bot**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve pairing">
    Start a chat with your bot in Telegram; you'll receive a **pairing code**. Enter it in "Enter pairing code from Telegram" and click **Approve Pairing**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
After starting a chat with your bot, you'll receive a pairing code. Enter it in the gateway UI to approve the connection.
</Info>

### Discord & WhatsApp

Use the same OpenClaw Gateway UI to add Discord and WhatsApp. Each channel has its own connect flow; follow the on-screen steps for each platform.

## Gateway Control

Manage your OpenClaw instance from the gateway dashboard.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Open Gateway UI" icon="window-maximize">
    Open the full OpenClaw gateway interface in a new tab.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Studio Link" icon="link">
    Quick link to OpenClaw Studio for advanced configuration.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Open Console" icon="terminal">
    Access the gateway console for logs and debugging.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Update OpenClaw" icon="arrow-up">
    Check for and apply OpenClaw updates.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Interactive Terminal (Recommended)

<Info>
**Open Machine Terminal** gives full support — works with `openclaw onboard`, `openclaw config --section channels`, and all interactive commands. No timeout.
</Info>

Use the terminal for:

- `openclaw onboard` — guided setup
- `openclaw config --section channels` — channel configuration
- Any other interactive OpenClaw commands

### Gateway Actions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Get Fresh URL" icon="rotate">
    Generate a new gateway URL if the current one has expired or changed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fix Gateway Origin" icon="wrench">
    Resolve origin/CORS issues if the gateway fails to load in the browser.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Restart Gateway" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Restart the OpenClaw gateway process. Use after config changes or if the gateway is unresponsive.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Refresh Status" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Update the displayed gateway status (e.g. Running / Stopped).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Auto-Approve Pairing" icon="check">
    Enable to automatically approve pairing requests for connected channels (e.g. Telegram).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Start Gateway" icon="play">
    Start the gateway if it is stopped. Required before messaging channels can receive messages.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Gateway URL & Status

After the gateway is running, you'll see:

- **Gateway URL** — A URL like `https://...proxy.daytona.works?token=...`. This is how messaging platforms reach your OpenClaw instance. Keep it private.
- **Status** — Typically **Running** when the gateway is active.

<Warning>
Do not share your gateway URL or token publicly. Anyone with the URL could send traffic to your gateway.
</Warning>

## Timeout & Sandbox

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Auto-stop after inactivity" icon="clock">
    The gateway auto-stops after a period of inactivity (e.g. **1 hour**) to save resources. The current setting is shown on the dashboard. To change the timeout, you may need to delete and recreate the setup.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wake Sandbox" icon="bolt">
    If the gateway has stopped due to inactivity, click **Wake Sandbox** to reactivate it without recreating the setup.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Help & Troubleshooting

Use the **Help & Troubleshooting** section in the OpenClaw Gateway UI for:

- Machine backend configuration issues
- Channel connection and pairing problems
- Gateway URL and origin errors
- OpenClaw CLI and terminal usage

## Removing the Setup

Click **Delete Messaging Setup** to remove the OpenClaw gateway and all channel connections. You can create a new setup later; you'll need to reconnect each channel (Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp) and re-enter tokens or pairing codes as required.

<Info>
Deleting the setup does not delete your agents — only the gateway and its channel links are removed.
</Info>
