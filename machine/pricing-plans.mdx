Storage limits apply to all files created or uploaded within Machine:

- **File uploads**: Count against your storage limit

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I know which plan is right for me?">
    Start with the plan that matches your expected usage. The Basic plan is perfect for individuals exploring Machine's capabilities. Professional is ideal for regular users who need more power and features. Enterprise is designed for organizations with specialized needs or larger teams.
    
    You can upgrade or downgrade at any time, so you're not locked into your initial choice.

  <Accordion title="What happens if I exceed my usage limit?">
    If you approach your usage limit, you'll receive notifications at 80% and 95% of your allocation. If you exceed your limit, you have two options:
