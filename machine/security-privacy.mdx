# Security & Privacy

Machine is built with a security-first approach, ensuring your data, conversations, and activities remain protected at all times.

## Data Protection

### Encryption

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Data in Transit" icon="lock">
    All communication between your devices and Machine uses TLS 1.3 encryption, ensuring that your data is secure as it travels across the internet.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data at Rest" icon="database-lock">
    Your stored data is encrypted using AES-256, protecting it from unauthorized access even in the unlikely event of a breach.
  </Card>
  <Card title="End-to-End Encryption" icon="key">
    Sensitive operations and files can be end-to-end encrypted, meaning only you can access the unencrypted data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Key Management" icon="key-skeleton">
    We use industry-standard key management services to securely store and rotate encryption keys.
