# Telegram Setup Guide

Connect your Machine agents to Telegram and chat with them from anywhere — in about 5 minutes.

## How It Works

Machine's Telegram Integration lets you connect any of your Machine agents to a Telegram bot. Once connected, anyone who messages your bot on Telegram will receive responses powered by your agent — complete with the model and instructions you've configured.

<Steps>
  <Step title="User sends message">

    Telegram forwards the message to Machine via webhook
  </Step>
  <Step title="Routed to your Agent">
    Machine routes the message to your selected agent
  </Step>
  <Step title="Agent generates response">
    Your agent processes the message using its configured model and instructions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reply sent on Telegram">
    The response is sent back to the user on Telegram
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Part 1 — Create a Bot on Telegram

~2 min

BotFather is Telegram's official tool for creating and managing bots. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather** (look for the blue verified checkmark ✓).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a chat with BotFather">
    Tap **Start** or type `/start`. BotFather will reply with a list of available commands.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a new bot">
    Send the command `/newbot`.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Name your bot">
    BotFather asks: "How are we going to call it?" — type any display name you like, e.g. **MyAssistantBot**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose a username">
    The username must end in **bot** or **Bot**. If it's taken, BotFather will ask you to try another.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Copy your API token">
    BotFather responds with "Done! Congratulations on your new bot." and provides:
    - A link to talk to your bot — e.g. `t.me/MyAssistantBot`
    - An API token — looks like `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNO...`
    
    <Warning>
      Keep your token secret! Anyone with this token can control your bot. If it ever gets leaked, revoke it with `/revoke` in BotFather.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Part 2 — Connect the Bot in Machine

~1 min

Now bring that bot token into Machine to link it with one of your agents.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Telegram page">
    In the Machine dashboard sidebar, click **Telegram** — or go directly to `/telegram`.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click 'Add Bot'">
    A configuration dialog will open with three fields.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Paste your Bot Token">
    In the Bot Token field, paste the API token from BotFather. Format: `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNO...`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select an Agent">
    Choose which Machine agent should handle incoming messages. This agent's instructions, personality, and tools will power your bot's responses.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select a Model (optional)">
    Optionally pick a specific AI model. If you leave this blank the bot uses the agent's default model.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click 'Save Configuration'">
    Machine validates your token, sets up the webhook automatically, and shows a success notification. Your bot appears in the Connected Bots table with a green **Active** badge.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Part 3 — Talk to Your Bot

Your bot is now live! Open Telegram, search for your bot's username (e.g. **@MyAssistantBot**), and tap **Start**.

```
@MyAssistantBot
online
/start
👋 Hello! I'm your Machine-powered assistant. Here's what I can help with…

Hey, you're my Telegram bot
That's right! I'm connected to your Machine agent. How can I help you today?

What can you do?
I can help with a variety of tasks — just ask me anything and I'll use all the tools and knowledge my agent has access to!
```

The bot maintains conversation context within each chat thread, so you can have natural back-and-forth conversations just like chatting with a person.

## Managing Your Bots

All your connected bots appear on the Telegram dashboard.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Change Model" icon="sliders">
    Click the pencil icon next to a bot, pick a new model, and save. The change takes effect immediately for new messages.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Disconnect a Bot" icon="trash">
    Click the trash icon and confirm. The bot stops responding, but you can reconnect it any time with the same token.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Multiple Bots" icon="layer-group">
    Machine supports multiple bots per account. Each can have its own agent and model — just click "Add Bot" again.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips & Best Practices

### Agent Configuration

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Customize Instructions" icon="pen">
    Customize your agent's instructions for Telegram's conversational style. Add instructions like "Keep responses concise and suitable for mobile messaging"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Message Length" icon="ruler">
    Telegram messages tend to be shorter — tune your prompts accordingly
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Security

<Warning>
Never share your bot token publicly — treat it like a password. If compromised: @BotFather → `/revoke`. Machine encrypts your bot token at rest.
</Warning>

## Advanced Branding & Groups

### Branding Your Bot

Use these BotFather commands to give your bot a professional identity:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="/setuserpic" icon="image">
    **Profile Picture** - Upload a 512x512 square logo
  </Card>
  <Card title="/setdescription" icon="file-lines">
    **Description** - Shown before users start the bot
  </Card>
  <Card title="/setabouttext" icon="info">
    **About Text** - Shown on the bot's profile page
  </Card>
  <Card title="/setcommands" icon="list">
    **Menu List** - Define your bot's slash command menu
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Group Chat Intelligence

When you add your bot to a group, Machine provides it with context about who is speaking.

<Info>
By default, bots only see messages that @mention them. To see all messages, use `/setprivacy` → Disable. Note: Changing privacy requires removing and re-adding the bot to the group.
</Info>

<Warning>
Disabling privacy increases credit usage as the bot processes all messages in the group.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Status shows 'Inactive'">
    The webhook may not have been set correctly. Try disconnecting and re-adding the bot.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Token is invalid">
    Make sure you copied the full token from BotFather. It should look like `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNO…`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bot isn't responding">
    Ensure an agent is selected in the Machine dashboard. If you revoked the token in BotFather, you'll need a new one.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bot responds slowly">
    Response time depends on the chosen model and agent complexity. Some models are faster than others.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Bot works in DMs but not in groups">
    Privacy Mode is on by default — use `/setprivacy` in BotFather to disable it, then remove and re-add the bot to the group.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Webhook Conflicts">
    If your bot stops responding, another service might have claimed the webhook. Simply click "Save Configuration" again in Machine to re-claim it.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
