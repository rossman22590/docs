# Using Machine

This guide walks you through the practical aspects of using Machine's interface to accomplish real-world tasks, using web development as an example.

## Interface Overview

Machine's interface is designed to be intuitive and conversation-driven. You'll work primarily through a chat interface where you can:

1. Ask questions and give instructions in natural language
2. View Machine's responses and suggested actions
3. Access workspace files and terminal commands
4. Preview results of your tasks

## Key Components

### Chat Interface

The main conversation area where you interact with Machine. Simply type your requests in natural language, and Machine will respond with text, suggested actions, or results.

### Terminal Access

Machine can execute terminal commands on your behalf. This is particularly useful for:
- Running development servers
- Installing dependencies
- Executing scripts
- Performing system operations

## Common Workflows

### Web Development Example

Let's walk through a common web development workflow using Machine:

#### 1. Setting Up a Project

Start by describing what you want to build:

```
You: "I need to create a real estate agency homepage with sections for about, contact information, and listings."
```

Machine will help you set up the project structure and create initial files:

```
Machine: "I'll help you create a real estate homepage. Let's start by setting up the basic project structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files."
```

#### 2. Running a Development Server

Machine can start a local development server for you:

```
You: "Can you start a local server so I can preview the site?"
```

Machine will execute the appropriate command:

```
Machine: "Starting a Python HTTP server on port 8000. You can view your site at http://localhost:8000"
```

#### 3. Making Content Updates

You can ask Machine to make specific updates to your files:

```
You: "Let me update the hero section text to reflect the new agency name."
```

Machine will help you edit the specific file and section:

```
Machine: "I'll help you update the hero section. Which agency name would you like to use?"
```

After providing the information, Machine will make the changes and show you what was updated:

#### 4. Real-time Previews

As you make changes, you can preview your website in real-time:

```
You: "Show me a preview of the website"
```

Machine will provide a way to view the current state of your project:

```
Machine: "Here's the current preview of your website. You can view it in your browser."
```

Machine can help you manage task lists and mark items as complete:

```
You: "Let me update the todo list to mark the final task as complete."
```

### Editing Specific Files

You can ask to edit specific files by name:

```
You: "Edit the index.html file to update the navigation links"
```

Machine will open the file and help you make precise changes.

## Best Practices

For the best experience when using Machine:
