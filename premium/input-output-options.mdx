2.  Draw: For those who require visual representations, the Draw feature enables the AI to create sketches or diagrams. This is particularly useful in fields like design, architecture, or any area where visual aids can enhance understanding.

3.  Reason + Act: This advanced feature allows the AI to not only process information but also make inferences and suggest actions based on the provided data. It's especially useful for scenario-based learning, problem-solving, and decision-making exercises.

4.  Browse Command: This advanced feature allows the AI to scrape a website and keep the content in context. Use /browse to activate!

Each option modifies how the AI processes your input and generates output, allowing for a customized chat generation experience tailored to your specific project or learning objective.
