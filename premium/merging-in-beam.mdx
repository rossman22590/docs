Merging Responses In Beam
=========================

### Understanding the Merge Toolbar in Your Application

The merge toolbar at the bottom of your interface is designed to enhance how you consolidate and refine AI-generated responses. This tool offers several options---Fuse, Guided, Compare, and Custom---each tailored to different needs and preferences. Here's a detailed look at how to utilize these features effectively:

#### Fuse

-   Usage: Ideal for integrating conversation details and ideas into a unified, clear response.

-   Process: Click on "Add Fusion" to start merging content. Note that while Fuse is excellent for textual content, it may not be as effective for coding-related responses.

#### Guided

-   Usage: Perfect for selectively curating information from various responses.

-   Process: Select "Guided" and then click "Add a Checklist". This enables you to create a checklist from your responses, allowing you to select specific information to retain. Confirm your selections to generate a new, consolidated response based on your choices.

#### Compare

-   Usage: Useful for a detailed analysis and comparison of different AI responses.

-   Process: Choose "Compare" and then "Add Breakdown". This function analyzes and compares responses, presenting them in a structured, empirical format that aids in making informed decisions about which elements to include in your final response.

#### Custom

-   Usage: Best for highly specific and tailored response merging.

-   Process: Use the Custom option to input your own merging prompt, which will guide the tool in combining all answers into a cohesive response according to your precise requirements.

#### Additional Tools and Settings

-   Merge Model Selection: Next to the merge toolbar, a dropdown allows you to select which model you'd like to use for merging your responses. Feel free to experiment with different models to find the one that best suits your needs.

-   Managing Responses: After merging, your original responses will remain accessible. You can remove any response using the minus button located at the top right corner of each response window. Additionally, if you change the merging model, you might want to redo the answer to reflect the new model's methodology.

### Conclusion

The merge toolbar is a powerful feature that brings flexibility and precision to how you handle AI-generated content. By understanding and utilizing the Fuse, Guided, Compare, and Custom options, you can tailor your responses to be as informative and effective as possible. Whether you're looking to create a comprehensive answer, select the best information, or compare insights, these tools provide the necessary functionality to enhance your decision-making and output quality.
