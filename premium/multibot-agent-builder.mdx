# General Overview

#### Introduction

MultiBot Agents provide a **flexible framework** for creating and managing custom AI assistants powered by various model providers. This feature allows users to build **specialized AI agents** with unique configurations, capabilities, and integrationsâ€”without requiring extensive coding knowledge.

MultiBot Agents function similarly to OpenAIâ€™s Assistants API and ChatGPTâ€™s GPTs but offer **broader model support** and a **no-code** implementation, making it easy to deploy AI-driven solutions for different tasks.

This guide provides a **comprehensive walkthrough** of setting up, configuring, and utilizing MultiBot Agents effectively.

### Getting Started with MultiBot Agents

#### Creating a New Agent

To create a new agent:

1. **Open the MultiBot Agents Panel**

   * Navigate to the **"Agents"** section from the endpoint menu.

   * Click on the **Agent Builder** in the Side Panel.

2. **Fill Out Agent Details**

   * **Avatar:** Upload a custom avatar for personalization.

   * **Name:** Choose a distinctive name for your agent.

   * **Description:** (Optional) Add a brief summary of your agentâ€™s purpose.

   * **Instructions:** Define system instructions to shape the agentâ€™s behavior.

   * **Model:** Select from available AI providers and models.

3. **Select an Existing Agent**

   * Agents can be selected from the **top dropdown menu** in the Side Panel.

   * You can also mention an agent in the chat using **"@"** in the input field.

***

### Model Configuration

The **Model Parameters Interface** allows fine-tuning of your agent's responses:

* **Temperature (0-1):** Adjust response creativity.

* **Max Context Tokens:** Set the memory limit for the conversation.

* **Max Output Tokens:** Define the maximum response length.

* **Provider-Specific Settings:** Customize parameters based on the chosen AI model.

***

### Agent Capabilities

#### **1. Code Interpreter**

When enabled, the **Code Interpreter** allows your agent to:

* Execute code in multiple programming languages, including:**Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, C, C++, Java, PHP, Rust, and Fortran.**

* Process files securely through the **MultiBot Code Interpreter API**.

* Run code without requiring local setup, configuration, or sandbox deployment.

* Handle file uploads and downloads seamlessly.

***

#### **2. File Search**

The **File Search** feature enables:

* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** AI can retrieve relevant information from uploaded documents.

* **Semantic Search:** AI understands document content contextually.

* **Context-Aware Responses:** AI can reference uploaded files in conversations.

* **File Attachment Support:** Attach documents at both the **agent** and **chat thread** levels.

***

### Tools & Integrations

### File Management

MultiBot Agents support **three types of file uploads**:

1. **Image Uploads:** For AI-based visual content processing.

2. **File Search Uploads:** Upload documents for **RAG** capabilities.

3. **Code Interpreter Uploads:** Upload files for **code execution**.

Files can be attached either:
âœ… **Directly to the agent configuration**
âœ… **Within individual chat threads**

***

### Best Practices

To ensure the best experience with MultiBot Agents:

âœ… **Provide clear, specific instructions** for your agent.
âœ… **Carefully select the necessary tools** for your use case.
âœ… **Organize files properly** across the three upload categories.
âœ… **Review sharing permissions** before making an agent public.
âœ… **Test your agent thoroughly** before deploying it.
