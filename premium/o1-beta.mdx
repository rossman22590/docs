## 7. OpenAI o1 Series Models

The o1 Beta platform now includes access to OpenAI's groundbreaking o1 series models, which represent a significant advancement in AI reasoning capabilities.

### 7.1 Overview of o1 Models

OpenAI o1 series models are new large language models trained with reinforcement learning to perform complex reasoning. These models excel in:

- Scientific reasoning
- Competitive programming (89th percentile on Codeforces)
- Advanced mathematics (top 500 students in USA Math Olympiad qualifier)
- PhD-level accuracy on physics, biology, and chemistry problems

### 7.2 Available o1 Models

Two reasoning models are available in the API:

1. **o1-preview**: An early preview designed to reason about hard problems using broad general knowledge.
2. **o1-mini**: A faster and cheaper version, particularly adept at coding, math, and science tasks where extensive general knowledge isn't required.

### 7.3 Key Features of o1 Models

- **Internal Reasoning**: o1 models think before they answer, producing a long internal chain of thought.
- **Reasoning Tokens**: These models use reasoning tokens to break down their understanding and consider multiple approaches.
- **Large Context Window**: Both models offer a context window of 128,000 tokens.

### 7.4 Using o1 Models in o1 Beta

To use o1 models in your o1 Beta application:

1. Select the desired o1 model from the model dropdown menu.
2. Craft your prompt or question.
3. Submit and wait for the response (response times may vary based on complexity).

### 7.5 Best Practices for o1 Models

- Keep prompts simple and direct.
- Avoid chain-of-thought prompts or instructions to "think step by step."
- Use delimiters for clarity in complex prompts.
- Limit additional context in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

### 7.6 Limitations During Beta

- Text-only input (no image support)
- Limited message types (user and assistant only)
- No streaming support
- No tool or function calling support
- Fixed parameters for temperature, top_p, and n

### 7.7 Managing Costs and Context

- Use the `max_completion_tokens` parameter to control total tokens generated.
- Reserve at least 25,000 tokens for reasoning and outputs when starting.
- Monitor the usage object in responses for token consumption details.

## 8. Advanced Features

[Content remains the same as in the previous version, with the addition of:]

- **Complex Reasoning**: Leverage o1 models for tasks requiring deep analysis and multi-step problem-solving.
- **Code Generation and Refactoring**: Utilize o1 models for advanced coding tasks and code improvements.

## 9. FAQ

**Q: What makes o1 Beta unique?**
A: o1 Beta offers access to cutting-edge AI models, including the o1 Preview model, with a highly customizable interface.

**Q: Can I switch between AI providers mid-conversation?**
A: Yes, you can switch providers, but note that context may not carry over between different AI models.

**Q: How secure is my data on o1 Beta?**
A: We employ industry-standard encryption and data protection measures. For details, please refer to our privacy policy.

**Q: Is there a limit to how many conversations I can have?**
A: Limits may vary based on your account type. Check your account details for specific information.

**Q: Can I export my conversations?**
A: Yes, o1 Beta allows you to export your chat history in various formats.

**Q: How do o1 models differ from GPT-4o models?**
A: o1 models excel in complex reasoning tasks but may have longer response times. GPT-4o models are better for applications requiring image inputs, function calling, or consistently fast responses.

**Q: Can I see the reasoning process of o1 models?**
A: The internal reasoning process (reasoning tokens) is not visible in the API output, but it contributes to the final response quality.

**Q: How can I optimize my prompts for o1 models?**
A: Keep prompts simple and direct, avoid instructing the model to explain its reasoning, and use clear delimiters for complex inputs.
