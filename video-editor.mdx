The **Video Editor** lets you create and manage **video projects** with a full timeline. Add clips, edit, add captions, and export.

## How to Open the Video Editor

- Click **Video Editor** in the sidebar (BETA badge), or use the Video Editor card on the Home page.

## Your Video Projects

- You’ll see a **list of your projects**. Each has a name, optional description, and thumbnail.
- **Create a project** — Use “Create project” or “New project” and give it a name.
- **Search** — Filter your projects by name.
- **Open one** — Click a project to edit it.

## Editing a Project

Inside a project you get:

- A **timeline** where you arrange clips and control timing.
- Tools to **add clips**, **edit captions**, and **trim** or adjust when things play.
- Your changes are saved as you work.

## When to Use What

- **Video Editor** — Best for longer or multi-clip videos where you need a timeline and full control.
- **Generate** — For single AI-generated clips (e.g. AnimateDiff, Pika, Veo). Those show up in your **Assets** and Generate history, not as timeline projects unless you bring them into the editor.

<Warning>
  Video Editor is in **BETA**. Some features or behavior may change over time.
