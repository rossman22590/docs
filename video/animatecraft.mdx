    - **Negative Prompt**: Specify elements to omit from the video.
    - **Aspect Ratio**: Choose between 16:9 and 9:16.
    - **Resolution**: Choose between 480p and 720p.
    - **CFG Scale**: Dictates how closely the video generation follows your prompt.
    - **Guidance Scale**: A second parameter for controlling the guidance scale.
    - **Number of Frames**: The number of frames in the output video.

## Mastering Prompts for AnimateCraft

To achieve the best results with AnimateCraft, focus on descriptive and specific prompts.

### Prompting Techniques:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific, Not Poetic" icon="pencil">
    Use real-world camera lingo (f/1.4, backlight, ISO) and descriptive terms like "frosted glass window" instead of "dreamy vibes." For example, instead of "a forest," try "a misty enchanted forest with glowing mushrooms, sunlight filtering through oak trees, soft piano music."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Focus on Motion" icon="film">
    Describe how the scene could come alive and become dynamic using brief phrases. Larger and more dynamic motions (like dancing, jumping, running, etc.) are preferred over smaller or more subtle ones (like standing still, sitting, etc.).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Describe Subject, Then Motion" icon="user">
    Start with the subject, then describe the motion. For example: "The girl dances gracefully, with clear movements, full of charm."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

    The man turns his head to the right, a subtle smile playing on his lips as his eyes meet the camera. The warm, golden hour light catches the highlights in his hair and the texture of his fleece jacket. The desert dunes in the background are cast in long shadows as the sun sets.
