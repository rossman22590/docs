Videos are everywhere, and making sure everyone can understand them is super important. That's where CaptionCraft comes in! It's a smart tool that helps you put words on your videos. CaptionCraft is easy to use and does the hard work for you. Just choose how you want your subtitles to look and let CaptionCraft handle the rest.

### **How CaptionCraft Works**

Upload Your Video:

*   Begin by uploading a video file of your choice to the CaptionCraft platform. Ensure that the video is 60 seconds or shorter to comply with the tool's guidelines.
    

Subtitle Position:

*   Choose where on the screen your subtitles will appear. You can opt for the traditional bottom-center placement or get creative with different positions that suit your video layout.
    

Max Character Space:

*   Set the maximum number of characters per line to ensure your subtitles are concise and easy to read.
    

Subtitle Font:

*   Select a font that complements your video's aesthetic and tone. CaptionCraft offers a variety of fonts to match your content's vibe.
    

Font Size:

*   Adjust the size of your subtitles for optimal readability without overshadowing your video content.
    

Font Background Opacity:

*   Choose the opacity of the subtitle background for better contrast. This helps your text stand out against diverse video backgrounds.
    

Border Stroke Width:

*   If you prefer, add a border around your text to enhance visibility, and decide how thick or thin this border should be.
    

Generate Your Video with Captions:

*   With all your preferences set, hit the 'Generate' button. CaptionCraft's AI will work its magic, synchronizing your text with your video's audio track, ensuring that your captions are timed perfectly with the spoken word.
    

Review and Download:

*   Once CaptionCraft has processed your video, you can review the captioned content to make sure everything looks just right. If you're satisfied with the result, you can download your newly captioned video, ready to be shared with the world.
    

### **Conclusion**

CaptionCraft is more than just a subtitling tool; it's an essential asset for enhancing viewer engagement, boosting SEO, and ensuring that your content is inclusive and accessible to all.
