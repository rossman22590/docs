## Mastering Prompts for FlixCraft

To achieve the best results with FlixCraft, focus on descriptive and specific prompts.

### Prompting Techniques:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Action" icon="film">
    **What is happening in the image or video?** Be specific about the actions of your subjects.
    <br/>
    *Example:* "A group of energetic hip-hop dancers with different styles dance street dance on a vast stage illuminated by bright neon lights."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Descriptive Language" icon="pencil">
    **Use adjectives to describe the setting, characters, and tone.** Instead of "a forest," try "a misty enchanted forest with glowing mushrooms, sunlight filtering through oak trees, soft piano music."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Camera Angles" icon="camera">
    **How close the audience is to the character or scene.** Is it a close-up, wide shot, or medium shot? For example: "A close up shot of the determined face of a battle-worn samurai."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Character or Camera Movement" icon="video-camera">
    **Is the camera static, or does it track along with a character?** Is it tilted down in a high-angle shot, or is it a Tarantino style crash-zoom towards the character in frame? For example: "Camera pulls back to reveal him standing alone on a foggy battlefield, gripping his katana."
  </Accordion>
