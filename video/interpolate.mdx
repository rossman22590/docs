# Interpolate Video: Smooth Motion Enhancement

<Tip>
  Transform choppy videos into smooth, fluid motion with our advanced AI-driven frame interpolation technology!
</Tip>

## What is Video Interpolation?

Video interpolation is the process of creating new, intermediate frames between existing frames in a video. This technique is used to increase the frame rate of a video, resulting in smoother motion and improved visual quality. When applied to a video, interpolation can:

- Reduce motion blur and stuttering
- Create a more cinematic feel
- Enhance the overall viewing experience

## How to Use Interpolate Video

Follow these steps to interpolate your video:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload Video" icon="upload">
    Upload a video file up to 11 seconds in length.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="https://img.mytsi.org/i/6Wf3809.png" alt="Video Upload Interface" />
    </Frame>
    
    <Callout type="info">
      You will see a preview of your input video after uploading.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select FPS and Recursive Passes" icon="sliders">
    Choose your desired frame rate and number of recursive passes.
    
    <Frame>

    </Frame>
    
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="FPS Options" icon="gauge">
        Currently supported options:
        - 24 FPS
        - 48 FPS
      </Accordion>
      
      <Accordion title="Recursive Passes" icon="rotate">
        You can choose between 1 or 2 recursive passes.
        - 1 Pass: Faster processing, good for most videos
        - 2 Passes: Higher quality, but longer processing time
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Interpolate Video" icon="play">
    Click the "Interpolate Video" button to start the process.
    
    <Callout type="warning">
      The interpolation process typically takes about 5 minutes, depending on your selected options and video length. Stay on the page until the interpolation is complete.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices for Video Interpolation

To achieve the best results with the Interpolate Video feature, consider these tips:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Choose High-Quality Source" icon="file-video">
    Start with the highest quality source video available for best results.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consider Content Type" icon="film">
    Fast-moving scenes may benefit more from interpolation than static scenes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Balance FPS and Quality" icon="scale-balanced">
    Higher FPS isn't always better. Choose based on your video content and intended use.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Experiment with Passes" icon="layer-group">
    Try both 1 and 2 passes to find the best balance between quality and processing time.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Advanced Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Understanding FPS Impact" icon="chart-line">
    - 24 FPS: Standard for cinematic content, good for most videos
    - 48 FPS: Creates ultra-smooth motion, ideal for action scenes or sports footage
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Optimizing for Different Content" icon="tv">
    - For slow-paced scenes: 24 FPS with 1 pass may be sufficient
    - For fast-action content: Consider 48 FPS with 2 passes for maximum smoothness
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Post-Interpolation Editing" icon="pen">
    After interpolation, you may want to:
    - Fine-tune color grading
    - Adjust contrast and brightness
    - Apply subtle motion blur for a more natural look
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Interpolate Video feature, try these solutions:

1. **Upload Failures**: Ensure your video file is in a supported format and doesn't exceed the 11-second limit.
2. **Poor Interpolation Results**: Try using a higher quality source video or experiment with different FPS and pass settings.
3. **Processing Errors**: If the interpolation process fails, try re-uploading the video or using a different browser.
4. **Artifacts in Output**: For complex scenes, try reducing the FPS or number of passes to minimize artifacts.

## Conclusion

The Interpolate Video feature offers a powerful solution for enhancing the smoothness and visual quality of your videos. By understanding the impact of different settings and following best practices, you can transform choppy footage into fluid, professional-looking content suitable for various applications.
