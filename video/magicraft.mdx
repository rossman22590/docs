    Close-up shot: the old sea captain stares intently, pipe in mouth, wisps of smoke curling around his weathered face. The camera begins a slow clockwise orbit, pulling back. Finally, the camera rises high above, revealing the entire wooden sailing ship cutting through the waves, the captain unmoved, gazing toward the distant horizon.

## Mastering Prompts for MagiCraft

To achieve the best results with MagiCraft, focus on descriptive and specific prompts.

### Prompting Techniques:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Hyper-Specific" icon="pencil">
    The more detail you provide, the more control you have. Instead of "fantasy armor," describe it: "ornate elven plate armor, etched with silver leaf patterns, with a high collar and pauldrons shaped like falcon wings."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Provide Context and Intent" icon="lightbulb">
    Explain the purpose of the image. The model's understanding of context will influence the final output.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Iterate and Refine" icon="recycle">
    Don't expect a perfect video on the first try. Use the conversational nature of the model to make small changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Step-by-Step Instructions" icon="list">
    For complex scenes with many elements, break your prompt into steps.
