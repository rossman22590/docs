### Prompt Structure

An effective prompt for MotionCraft Ultra should include the following elements:

1. **Subject Description**: Clearly define the main focus of your video.
2. **Scene/Setting**: Describe the environment where the action takes place.
3. **Action/Movement**: Specify any actions or changes occurring in the scene.
4. **Lighting and Color**: Describe the lighting conditions and color palette.
5. **Style and Mood**: Specify the overall aesthetic and emotional tone.
6. **Camera Movements**: While MotionCraft Ultra may not always perfectly execute camera movements, including them can help guide the AI's interpretation of the scene.

### Key Prompting Techniques

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific and Descriptive" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Provide detailed information about subjects, environments, and actions. MotionCraft Ultra excels at interpreting and executing complex prompts.
    
    Example: Instead of "a woman walking," use "a tall, elegant woman with flowing silver hair and a crimson dress glides gracefully through a moonlit Victorian garden, her dress trailing behind her."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Specify Lighting and Atmosphere" icon="sun">
    Detail the lighting conditions and mood to set the right ambiance for your video.
    
    Example: "The scene is bathed in the soft, ethereal glow of bioluminescent plants, casting a blue-green light that dances across the character's face, creating an otherworldly atmosphere."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use Cinematic Language" icon="film">
    Employ film terminology to guide the AI in creating more professional-looking shots.
    
    Example: "Begin with a wide establishing shot of the futuristic cityscape, then smoothly transition to a medium close-up of the protagonist, their face illuminated by the glow of holographic billboards."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Incorporate Dynamic Elements" icon="wind">
    Describe moving elements in the scene to take advantage of MotionCraft Ultra's ability to render motion.
    
    Example: "In the background, hover cars weave through the neon-lit skyscrapers, while in the foreground, the protagonist's long coat billows dramatically in the wind."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Style and Artistic References" icon="palette">
    MotionCraft Ultra understands various artistic styles. Reference specific styles or artists to guide the aesthetic.
    
    Example: "Create the scene in the style of a Blade Runner-esque cyberpunk world, with hints of Art Nouveau in the architectural details."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Advanced Prompting Strategies

1. **Emotional Progression**: Guide the AI to show a shift in mood or emotion throughout the 6-second clip.
   
   Example: "The character's expression transitions from curiosity to awe as they witness the alien landscape unfold before them."

2. **Contrasting Elements**: Combine contrasting elements to create visually interesting scenes.
   
   Example: "A sleek, futuristic robot tends to a lush, overgrown garden filled with vibrant, old-fashioned roses."

3. **Temporal Hints**: While the clip is only 6 seconds, you can suggest the passage of time.
   
   Example: "As the character walks, the scene transitions from day to night, with streetlights flickering to life."

4. **Focus on Details**: MotionCraft Ultra can render intricate details, so don't hesitate to describe them.
   
   Example: "Zoom in on the character's eyes, revealing intricate, clockwork-like cybernetic implants with gears that spin as they blink."

### Leveraging the Magic Prompt Feature

MotionCraft Ultra offers a Magic Prompt feature to enhance your prompts:

</Frame>

The Magic Prompt feature automatically refines and expands your initial prompt. Here's how to make the most of it:

1. **Start with a Basic Idea**: Input a simple concept or scene description.
2. **Review the Enhanced Prompt**: The Magic Prompt will generate a more detailed version.
3. **Edit and Refine**: Use the enhanced prompt as a starting point, then edit it to better match your vision.
4. **Iterate**: If the result isn't quite what you wanted, try running the Magic Prompt again with your edited version.

### Example Prompts

Let's look at a few example prompts that showcase effective techniques:

  <CodeBlock title="Cyberpunk City">
    ```plaintext
    A neon-drenched cyberpunk cityscape at night. Towering skyscrapers with holographic advertisements 
    stretch into a smog-filled sky. On a crowded street, a diverse group of pedestrians with 
    cybernetic enhancements hurry past. Focus on a street vendor's stall selling glowing, 
    otherworldly food. The camera starts with a wide shot, then smoothly zooms in on a customer 
    with glowing cybernetic eyes examining a pulsating, bioluminescent fruit. The scene is lit by 
    a mix of harsh neon signs and soft, ethereal bioluminescence, creating a contrast of cool blues 
    and warm pinks. The atmosphere is bustling yet mysterious, with an undercurrent of tension.
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
  
  <CodeBlock title="Nature Transformation">
    ```plaintext
    A serene forest glade transforms through the seasons in a magical time-lapse. Begin with a 
    wide shot of the glade covered in snow, bare trees framing the scene. As the camera slowly 
    pans right, spring blossoms burst forth, flowers blooming in fast motion. Continuing the 
    pan, the scene shifts to summer, lush green foliage filling the frame. Finally, as the 
    camera completes its movement, autumn colors explode across the landscape, leaves falling 
    in a golden cascade. Throughout the sequence, a majestic stag remains in the center, aging 
    slightly with each season. The lighting changes from cool winter tones to warm summer hues, 
    ending with the rich, golden light of autumn.
    ```
  </CodeBlock>
