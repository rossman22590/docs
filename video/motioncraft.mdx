Immerse yourself in the dynamic world of 'MotionCraft', where still images are reimagined with the magic of movement. This innovative tool doesn't just bring photos to life but infuses them with authentic motion, turning static moments into captivating scenes.

### **How to Use MotionCraft**

Choose a File:

*   Start by selecting the 'Choose File' button to upload the photo you want to animate from your device.
    

Motion Bucket ID Slider:

*   The 'Motion Bucket ID' slider allows you to choose from a range of motion templates. Slide to select the type of movement that best fits your image, whether it's a gentle drift or a more pronounced action.
    

Cond Aug Slider:

*   With the 'Cond Aug' slider, you can adjust the intensity of the motion effect. This helps in fine-tuning how subtle or dramatic you want the animation to be within the photo.
    

Prompt:

*   Use the prompt box to describe the motion you envision. This could be anything from "leaves fluttering in the wind" to "a person waving their hand". The more descriptive you are, the better the result.
    

Seed and Guidance Scale:

*   The 'Seed' determines the starting point of the motion's randomness, while the 'Guidance Scale' controls how closely the animation follows your prompt. Together, they provide a balance between unpredictability and accuracy in the resulting motion.
    

Generate Image:

*   After setting all your parameters, click 'Generate Image'. 'MotionCraft' will then process your inputs and apply the motion to your still image, bringing it to animated life.
    

### **If you don't want to input an image**

*   You can just add in a prompt of whatever you want to generate and you will get an animated video in seconds!
    
*   Make sure to add a detailed prompt and adjust the settings to your liking and start generating.
