## Mastering Prompts for PikaCraft

To achieve the best results with PikaCraft, focus on descriptive and specific prompts.

### Prompting Techniques:

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Motion Strength" icon="film">
    Adjust how much movement is in your video using the `-motion` parameter. The default setting is 1, and you can select a value from 0 to 4. For example: `-motion 3`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Guidance Scale" icon="sliders">
    The `-gs` parameter helps adjust how closely your video will follow your text prompt. Choose a value between 8–24, with 12 as the default. For example: `-gs 16`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Negative Prompting" icon="ban">
    The `-neg` parameter is used to exclude specific elements you don’t want in your video. You can specify words to avoid. For example: `-neg words letters signs`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Aspect Ratio" icon="crop">
    With the `-ar` parameter, you can set the width:height ratio of your video, with options like 16:9, 9:16, 1:1, and 4:5. For example: `-ar 16:9`
