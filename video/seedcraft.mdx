    ```text
    A little girl is playing with her puppy on the living room carpet. The camera starts at the eye level of the puppy on the ground. The puppy runs joyfully toward the girl, with the camera following steadily. As it nears the girl, it pans up to reveal her gentle smile; as the girl and puppy play, the camera slowly rotates 360 degrees in a close, slow circle around them. Finally, as the girl picks up the puppy, the camera gradually zooms in from below, freezing on their intimate faces. Warm and loving, with soft visuals.
