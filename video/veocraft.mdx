## Mastering Prompts for VeoCraft

To achieve the best results with VeoCraft, focus on descriptive and specific prompts.

### The 8-Part Framework

A professional prompt should include:

1.  **Scene**: A clear sentence describing the overall action and vibe.
2.  **Visual Style**: Define your aesthetic (cinematic, realistic, animated, surreal).
3.  **Camera Movement**: Specify camera behavior (static, slow pan, tracking, aerial).
4.  **Main Subject**: Detail who or what the camera should focus on.
5.  **Background**: Describe the setting and era if relevant.
6.  **Lighting and Mood**: Set the emotional tone through lighting choices.
7.  **Audio Cue**: Include music, ambience, or sound effects.
8.  **Color Palette**: Guide the overall color scheme.

### Prompting Techniques

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Precise Language" icon="pencil">
    Be very specific and precise with your words. Always say exactly what you mean. You're talking to an AI, not a friend.
    <br/>
    *Example:* Instead of "A girl cooking dinner," use "A young woman in her early 20s cooking dinner."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Layer Your Prompts" icon="layer-group">
    Start with the core action, then add technical details, style elements, and audio.
    <br/>
    *Example:* "A golden retriever running through a meadow at sunset, medium shot with warm lighting, tail wagging happily, birds chirping in the background."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific About Timing" icon="clock">
    Use timing words to control the flow of your video.
    <br/>
    *Slow:* gradual, slowly, gentle, smooth, flowing
    <br/>
    *Fast:* sudden, quick, rapid, instant, sharp
    <br/>
    *Rhythmic:* rhythmic, steady, pulsing, beating, repeating
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Combine Technical and Creative Language" icon="camera">
    Mix camera terms with descriptive words to give you both technical control and creative freedom.
    <br/>
    *Example:* "Close-up of weathered hands kneading bread dough."
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Consider Cause and Effect" icon="link">
    Think about how actions create reactions to make your videos feel more real and connected.
    <br/>
    *Example:* "A child blowing dandelion seeds, causing them to drift away in the breeze while the camera follows their floating path."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Too Vague**: Instead of "A person in a room," use "A chef in a busy kitchen preparing pasta."
- **Too Complicated**: Instead of "A dragon flying through space while singing opera," use "A dragon soaring through clouds at sunset."
- **Missing Audio**: Instead of "A waterfall in the mountains," use "A waterfall cascading down rocky cliffs with the sound of rushing water echoing."
- **No Timing**: Instead of "Flowers growing," use "Flowers gradually blooming in morning sunlight."

## JSON Prompting for VeoCraft

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data format that allows for structured, readable, and machine-compatible data exchange. When used in AI video generation, it helps to break down a prompt into key-value pairs that define the components of a video.

### Why Use JSON Prompting?

- **Enhanced Consistency**: Ensure that key elements of your video remain consistent across multiple scenes.
- **Improved Control**: Dictate the parameters for every visual, sound, and environmental detail.
- **Efficiency in Iteration**: Quickly test different versions of a video by adjusting individual parameters.

### Best Practices for Crafting JSON Prompts

- **Be Descriptive**: The more detailed your descriptions, the better the AI can interpret your vision.
- **Specify Audio Elements**: Include any ambient sounds, music, or dialogue in the prompt.
- **Use Cinematic Terminology**: Terms like "dolly zoom," "bokeh effect," and "golden hour lighting" will guide the AI to create visuals with a high degree of realism and cinematic flair.
- **Iterate and Refine**: Don’t hesitate to experiment with different settings.
